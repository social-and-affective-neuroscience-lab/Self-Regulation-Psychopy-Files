005:0010,"1) The National Farm Administration (NFA) has been concerned over the last decade with the struggles of barley growers.
Plan: In an effort to support these barley growers, two years ago, the NFA began a program of sending them, each autumn, a free special mix of fertilizer and enzymes designed to multiply barley yield, to be applied the following spring during first growth.  This mix had been stunningly successful in multiplying the yield of barley in laboratory conditions.
Results: Most barley growers reported little change in their economic status over this two year period.

Further information: All barley growers received the shipments, and all used them.  Weather conditions have been fair to optimal for barley growth over the past two years.

In light of the further information, which of the following, if true, does most to explain the result that followed the implementation of the plan?","(A) During these two years, most of the barley growers reported using no other fertilizer besides the special mix sent by the government",(B) The trucks that drove the special mix from the depot in Wisconsin to the individual farms sometime took as much as 4 or 5 days.,(C) Some of the enzymes in the special mix multiply the growth of a bacteria that feeds on the young barley plants.,(D) This program was implemented at a time when more than half of barley growers nationwide were reported barely breaking even in their yearly expenses.,"(E) This was the second such NFA program to aid barley growers; the first one, 14 years ago, was started with high hopes, but did little to change their situation.",c,"1) The Green Peas Grocery Store in the remote wealthy enclave of Luxville charges more than the Green Peas Grocery Store in Oak City charges for the same items. Clearly, on any given item, the Green Peas grocery franchise is taking advantage of its location in Luxville to reap higher profits on that item.

In evaluating the argument, it would be most useful to compare",(A) the selection of specialty items in the Oak City location with the selection of specialty items in the Luxville location.,(B)the cost of transporting merchandise to the Oak City location with the comparable cost to the Luxville location.,(C) the average cost of the same or comparable items at other grocery stores in Oak City with the average cost at other stores in Luxville.,(D)the percent of average household income spent on groceries in Oak City with the comparable percentage in Luxville.,(E) the cost of these items in Oak City and in Luxville with the cost at other Green Peas stores throughout the state.,b,"1)Several critics have claimed that any contemporary poet who writes formal poetry—poetry that is rhymed and metered—is performing a politically conservative act. This is plainly false. Consider Molly Peacock and Marilyn Hacker, two contemporary poets whose poetry is almost exclusively formal and yet who are themselves politically progressive feminists.

The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?",(A) No one who is a feminist is also politically conservative.,(B)No poet who writes unrhymed or unmetered poetry is politically conservative.,(C)No one who is politically progressive is capable of performing a politically conservative act,(D)Anyone who sometimes writes poetry that is not politically conservative never writes poetry that is politically conservative.,"(E)The content of a poet’s work, not the work’s form, is the most decisive factor in determining what political consequences, if any, the work will have.",c,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,9.433967299992219,None,12.480399199994281,None,1,13.938707199995406,12.480399199994281,None,12.480399199994281,None,12.480399199994281,None,12.480399199994281,None,12.480399199994281,None,12.480399199994281,None,12.480399199994281,None,26.450135799997952,27.95138639997458,28.00187709997408,None,28.00187709997408,None,28.00187709997408,None,28.00187709997408,None,2,4.801984799967613,28.00187709997408,None,33.60654752998962,None,return,5.583758599997964,28.00187709997408,None,33.78436399996281,None,a,10.698710099968594,33.78436399996281,45.632869499968365,return,11.800883800024167,33.78436399996281,45.632869499968365,33.78436399996281,None,33.78436399996281,None,33.78436399996281,None,33.78436399996281,None,33.78436399996281,None,45.61600439995527,47.117846599954646,,001,2019_Oct_28_1136,AcademicSR,3.2.4,60.10214962166531,
005:0010,"2) Linda: In the 1800s, it was found that one in every six women who gave birth in hospitals died of a fever they had contracted after delivering the child and that the mortality was not as high if they gave birth at home with the help of a mid wife. It was found that the doctors had a poorer sense of hygiene and that their dirty hands and instruments were leading to pathogens entering a woman's bloodstream. Thankfully, hygienic conditions today are much better and women are safer.

Fiona: But doctors today are so overworked that a number of doctors, while aware of the need for better hygiene, barely find the time to wash their hands. The likelihood of infections caused by doctors is probably not any better.

Which of the following can be used by Fiona to further establish that Linda need not be correct in her reasoning?","(A) A nationwide survey found that doctors, especially experienced ones, are more prone to the belief that they could not possibly be carrying pathogens.","(B) It is reported that around 50,000 people die every year in our country from hospital acquired infections.",(C ) Compulsory hand cleansing is strictly adhered to by all doctors and nurses before every major surgical procedure.,"(D) During a study, doctors handling newborn babies self reported a hand cleansing rate of 90℅.","(E ) Nurses are not any better than doctors in adhering to strict cleansing schedules, especially when busy.",a,"2) In the years since the city of London imposed strict air-pollution regulations on local industry, the number of bird species seen in and around London has increased dramatically. Similar air-pollution rules should be imposed in other major cities.

Each of the following is an assumption made in the argument above EXCEPT:","(A) In most major cities, air-pollution problems are caused almost entirely by local industry.",(B) Air-pollution regulations on industry have a significant impact on the quality of the air. ,(C)The air-pollution problems of other major cities are basically similar to those once suffered by London. ,(D)An increase in the number of bird species in and around a city is desirable.,(E)The increased sightings of bird species in and around London reflect an actual increase in the number of species in the area. ,a,"2) About two million years ago, lava dammed up a river in western Asia and caused a small lake to form. The lake existed for about half a million years. Bones of an early human ancestor were recently found in the ancient lake-bottom sediments that lie on top of the layer of lava. Therefore, ancestors of modern humans lived in western Asia between two million and one-and-a-half million years ago.

Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?",(A)There were no other lakes in the immediate area before the lava dammed up the river.,(B)The lake contained fish that the human ancestors could have used for food.,(C)The lava that lay under the lake-bottom sediments did not contain any human fossil remains.,(D)The lake was deep enough that a person could drown in it.,(E)The bones were already in the sediments by the time the lake dried up.,e,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,47.25695879996056,47.25695879996056,b,1.8181353000109084,47.25695879996056,49.78598329995293,return,2.4887797000119463,47.25695879996056,49.78598329995293,47.25695879996056,47.25695879996056,47.25695879996056,47.25695879996056,47.25695879996056,47.25695879996056,47.25695879996056,47.25695879996056,47.25695879996056,47.25695879996056,49.76945219998015,51.27051760000177,,001,2019_Oct_28_1136,AcademicSR,3.2.4,60.10214962166531,
