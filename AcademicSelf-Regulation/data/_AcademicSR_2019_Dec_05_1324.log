This is a military practice that is unfair and must be avoided. The army must take responsibility for the same and stop discharging their soldiers dishonorably.\n\nChristy: While it is true that it is unfair to the soldiers to be discharged so from the army, it has also been found that there are no sufficient measures or systems that have been created to identify whether the misconduct was due to trauma or due to other reasons. Moreover, to enforce discipline in the ranks, it is important for the army to follow a uniform rule for all the soldiers.\n\nWhich of the following statements can Christy further add to her argument?'), ('GMATQA', '(A)If there is no proper system, then the army should have developed a proper system by now.'), ('GMATQB', '(B)Complete elimination of dishonorable discharges would make it more difficult for the army to monitor and evaluate the soldiers.'), ('GMATQC', '(C)It is not the army’s fault that there has been no system developed to help those with PTSD'), ('GMATQD', '(D)Studies have also found that showing consideration for some soldiers has led to others taking advantage, indirectly promoting misconduct.'), ('GMATQE', '(E)There have been instances when the army has been able to identify the reasons for the misconduct and acted accordingly.'), ('GMATAs', 'd'), ('GRE', '5) Coursemetrics, a privately owned on-line education platform, recently offered courses targeted to college students.
