REACT,0010:0015,"1)During the last 50 years in England, the national football team has had at least 60℅ of its players born during the months January to March. Similarly, in Germany, at least 50℅ of the team has been born during the first three months of the year. In fact, this statistic holds true for most European countries. This shows that in most European countries, parents with kids born early in the year are more likely to encourage a football career.

Which of the following best explains why the conclusion need not be the best explanation for the statistic?","(A)Of the remaining members, 60℅ or more tend to be born between the months of April and June.",(B)Parents of kids born in the second half of the year have displayed a measurable intent to promote scholarly careers,"(C)The age cut-off for kids to try out for a team in most European countries is calculated as on December 31 of any year and older the kid during trials, greater the chances of getting the right opportunities.",(D)The school year usually begins in April in most European countries and many parents are known to encourage students to work on their academics and not sports during the school year.,"(E)During the last 50 years, on average 30℅ of the kids have been born during the first three months of the year.

",(C)The chair of the new council must be a person who can communicate directly with the leaders of the nation's largest labor unions. ,(D)Most of the other members of the new council will be representatives of business management interests.,(E) An understanding of the needs and problems of labor is the only quallification necessary for the job of chairing the new council. ,e,"1)Biologists attached a radio transmitter to one of a number of wolves that had been released earlier in the White River Wilderness Area as part of a relocation project. The biologists hoped to use this wolf to track the movements of the whole pack. Wolves usually range over a wide area in search of prey, and frequently follow the migrations of their prey animals. The biologists were surprised to find that this particular wolf never moved more than five miles away from the location in which it was first tagged.


Which one of the following, if true, would by itself most help to explain the behavior of the wolf tagged by the biologists?","(A)The area in which the wolves were released was rocky and mountainous, in contrast to the flat, heavily-wooded area from which they were taken. ","(B)The wolf had been tagged and released by the biologists only three miles away from a sheep ranch that provided a large, stable population of prey animals.","(C)The White River Wilderness Area had supported a population of wolves in past years, but they had been hunted to extinction.","(D) Although the wolves in the White River Wilderness Area were under government protection, their numbers had been sharply reduced, within a few years of their release, by illegal hunting.","(E)The wolf captured and tagged by the biologists had split off from the main pack whose movements the biologists had hoped to study, and its movements did not represent those of the main pack.",b,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,6.209773299982771,None,space,1.3880535999778658,6.209773299982771,None,13.128021399956197,None,10.145331300096586,None,15.643596600042656,None,1,1.7460558998864144,15.643596600042656,None,15.643596600042656,None,15.643596600042656,None,15.643596600042656,None,15.643596600042656,None,15.643596600042656,None,15.643596600042656,None,17.415171400178224,18.91599060012959,18.93628460005857,None,18.93628460005857,None,18.93628460005857,None,18.93628460005857,None,3,2.9336338001303375,18.93628460005857,None,22.635978640150277,None,return,3.6840238999575377,18.93628460005857,None,22.636252199998125,None,space,7.041465099900961,22.636252199998125,None,29.860703200101852,None,None,29.860703200101852,32.427562300115824,return,2.5191530999727547,29.860703200101852,32.427562300115824,29.860703200101852,None,29.860703200101852,None,29.860703200101852,None,29.860703200101852,None,29.860703200101852,None,32.410638300003484,34.912939600180835,,001,2019_Dec_05_1318,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.648254219101055,
REACT,0010:0015,"2) Studies have established that children who watched 2 more hours of TV on an average daily basis during the first 15 years of their life were 50℅ more likely to be arrested for property crimes in the country. Researchers believe that these studies clearly establish that violence in movies and TV contribute to aggressive behavior in real life. On the other hand, there is no clear evidence that the programs that the kids watched on TV were violent in the first place. Even if we were to accept that TV watching contributed to the increased crime rate, it need not have been because of the nature of the programs. Perhaps, children who watched programs such as Adams and Samson, a funny sit-com about two blundering cops began perceiving all cops as incompetent.

REACT,0010:0015,"3) During medieval times, the administrative system was organized such that jobs were traditionally held within the same family. The eldest son of the village's blacksmith will take up his father’s business and become the next blacksmith. The other sons would join the army or serve the king in some fashion while the daughters did what their mother did. Although the world has undergone innumerable changes, the dynastic system has not undergone any change whatsoever. Children who have fathers who played major league baseball are 800 times more likely than other kids to become major league players themselves.

REACT,0010:0015,"4) A survey conducted recently in the city indicated that most college welfare-aid applicants understate the number of luxury items - such as cars and TVs – that their family owned, in an effort to maximize the amount of aid they can claim from the city. Paradoxically, the same study also found that many applicants claimed that they had running water and a gas connection even when they did not.

REACT,0010:0015,"5) Terrorist attacks invariably lead to tremendous losses in life, property, and morale of a country. The effects of a terrorist attack are not just immediate and can have long-lasting, trickle-down effects as well. The fear, for example, takes a long time to die down. However, some of these repercussions can be beneficial to the country. Take for instance, the recent terrorist attack on our capital city. In the weeks following the attack, the crime rate in the city came down significantly from what it was just before the attack. This must primarily be due to the increased presence of police resources that were moved to the area and is thus an indirect effect of the attack.

Which of the following options gives one more option as to why the crime rate decreased because of the terrorist attacks?",(A)The capital city is under increased monitoring leading to quick detection of crimes - many times while the crime is still underway.,(B)A number of people are frightened because of the terrorist attacks and have fled the capital city.,(C)There was a recorded decrease in crime rate right after the terrorist attack in almost all cities of the country.,(D)Intel reports show that the terrorists who pulled off the attack had been committing various other smaller crimes regularly to distract law enforcement from their true purposes.,(E)The government had initiated schemes to decrease poverty and provide better livelihood for the people just before the terrorist attack.,d,"5) Some commentators complain that a “litigation explosion” in the past decade has led to unreasonably high costs for U.S. businesses by encouraging more product liability suits against manufacturers.

",(B)Several of the largest awards ever made in product liability cases occurred within the last two years. ,(C)The rise of the consumer movement has encouraged citizens to seek legal redress for product flaws. ,"(D) Lawyers often undertake product liability cases on a contingency basis, so their payment is based on the size of the damages awarded.",(E)) Juries often award damages in product liability suits out of emotional sympathy for an injured consumer. ,a,"5)Many home renters buy their first homes believing that it is clearly more profitable to make mortgage payments than to pay rent.
