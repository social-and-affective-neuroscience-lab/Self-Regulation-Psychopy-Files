0015:0020,"1) In 2009, there was a sharp increase in the number of people who were reported to have died in the country during the first week of the year, compared with the first week of the previous ten years. There seems to be no reason to explain this disproportionately high number of deaths especially because the reports were widespread in the country and there was no epidemic spreading through the country at that point in time. Moreover, most of the deaths were not among the young and could not even be attributed to binge drinking in celebration of the new year.

Which of the following can then explain the discrepancy?","(A)The government announced in 2008 that estate taxes, payable by the heirs on someone's death, would be abolished effective from the new year.","(B)Astrologists predicted that 2009 was a good year to die in, for salvation of the soul.",(C)The statistic is an anomaly that has no logical explanation.,"(D)The price of some cancer drugs and chemotherapy increased by 10% in January 2009, making treatment more expensive than before.",(E)An earthquake in one of the cities during December 2008 made hospital care availability more difficult for regular illnesses.,a,"1) In an experiment, two different types of recorded music were played for neonates in adjacent nurseries in a hospital. In nursery A, classical music was played; in nursery B, rock music was played. After two weeks, it was found that the babies in nursery A cried less, suffered fewer minor ailments, and gained more weight than did the babies in nursery B.

In evaluating the validity of the conclusion suggested by the experiment above, it would be most important to know which of the following?",(A) The musical preferences of the parents of the two groups of newborns. ,(B) Whether the newborns in both nurseries were equally healthy and happy at the start of the experiment. ,(C)Whether loud rock music can damage the hearing of newborns.,(D)What the average weight of the neonates wasa before and after the experiment. ,(E)Whether the music was played in the nurseries at all times or only at certain times.,b,"1)The price of a barrel of crude oil fell by 15 percent over the last month. Economists point to several causes, including the discovery of new reserves of oil, the increased accessibility of alternative sources of fuel, the growth of mass transit, the decline of car sales, and the increase in non-fuel-consuming means of transportation, such as bicycles, over the same time frame.

Which of the following does the above argument NOT imply?","(A)The discovery of new reserves of oil has increased the supply, created a surplus, and thus driven the price of oil down.",(B)People are more likely to purchase new cars if the price of oil is low.,"(C)If they have access to both, some people would rather use alternative sources of fuel instead of oil.","(D)The growth of mass transit systems, which transport more people and use less fuel, has reduced demand for oil and driven the price of oil down.",(E)The increased accessibility of alternative sources of fuel has reduced the demand for oil and thus driven the price of a barrel of crude oil down.,b,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,9.682002599991392,None,12.697653600000194,None,1,0.5225130000035278,12.697653600000194,None,12.697653600000194,None,12.697653600000194,None,12.697653600000194,None,12.697653600000194,None,12.697653600000194,None,12.697653600000194,None,13.247711699994397,14.74778599999263,14.797704099997645,None,14.797704099997645,None,14.797704099997645,None,14.797704099997645,None,2,3.10120150000148,14.797704099997645,None,18.980732879995777,None,return,4.154386900001555,14.797704099997645,None,19.430856199993286,None,a,3.091076900003827,19.430856199993286,24.897670899998047,return,5.4287649000034435,19.430856199993286,24.897670899998047,19.430856199993286,None,19.430856199993286,None,19.430856199993286,None,19.430856199993286,None,19.430856199993286,None,24.880999699991662,27.381211999992956,,001,2019_Oct_29_1352,AcademicSR,3.2.0,59.84204094939996,
