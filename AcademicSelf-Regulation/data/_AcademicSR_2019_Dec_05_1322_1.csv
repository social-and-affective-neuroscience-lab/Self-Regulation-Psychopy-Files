REACT,0020:0025,"1) Jess: To be a woman in this century is far better than to be a woman in centuries past. Life expectancy for women has - for the first time - surpassed that for men and while only around 20℅ of college students in the late 1800s were women, today, almost 60℅ of college students are women.

Sam: However, women educated in the top-ranked colleges in the country earn only about 70℅ of what their male counterparts earn. Also, studies show that even today, in a number of industries, women are refused top management positions simply because they are women.

Which of the following is Jess most likely to say in response to Sam?","(A)Women today are healthier and live longer than women in the 1800s, who primarily died because of child birth.",(B)There are more women at the entry-level jobs of most industries than there are men.,(C)Women today are better able to juggle professional and personal lives and a number of them are proving to be successful single mothers.,(D)The proportion of women in the judicial and legislative branches of the country is at its highest and the country elected its first woman president recently.,(E)Women are allowed more freedom today and are not likely to be sacrificed at the altar of marriage or in a witch hunt.,d,"1) Unlike the lungs and the kidneys, the liver is an organ well suited for living-donor transplants to children because the portion of the liver must be removed from a healthy adult to replace the diseased liver of a child will be regenerated in the healthy adult within a few months.

Which of the following, if true, provides the most additional support for the conclusion drawn above?",(A)  The success rate of liver transplants is slightly lower in children than in adults.,"(B) In removing the portion of liver for transplant there is danger of causing damage to the spleen of the donor, and that could necessitate the removal of the spleen.",(C) There is less danger that a transplanted organ will be rejected when the organ donor is a close relative of the recipient.,(D) There are so few suitable donors that about one-half of the babies with liver disease born in the United States each year die before they can receive a liver transplant.,"(E)Each lobe of the liver functions separately, and it is possible to extract a portion of one lobe without disrupting critical liver functions.",e,"1)Modern workers are less competent than workers of the past.  This fact likely comes as a surprise to some because standards are higher than ever.  Employers demand higher degrees than before and more workers have bachelor's and master's degrees than at any other time.  Higher degrees do not mean more competent workers, however.  Recent evidence indicates that modern workers have poor writing ability, lack focus, and are inept at personal communication.

Which of the following, if true, most undermines the argument?","(A)Modern workers generally work more hours than workers in the past

","(B)Workers of the past often obtained bachelor's and master's degrees

","(C)Workers of the past had poor writing ability, lacked focus, and were inept at personal communication

","(D)In the past, it was often more difficult to obtain a bachelor's or master's degree

REACT,0020:0025,"2) Artistic success as an actor is directly dependent on how well an actor has developed his craft. This has been demonstrated by the discovery of a positive relationship between the number of classes taken by an actor and the number of professional productions in which the actor has appeared in the past two years.

Each of the following, if true, cast doubt on the author's argument about artistic success for actors EXCEPT:",(A)The figures for the number of classes taken were based solely on information provided by actors.,(B)Success as an actor cannot necessarily be judged exclusively by recent credits.,"(C)For most successful actors, it's not the quantity but the quality of their classes that has helped to develop their craft",(D)There is no relationship between the number of professional productions in which an actor has appeared and true artistic success.,(E)Most successful actors have taken only a small number of intensive classes.,a,"2) Popcorn kernels explode, or "pop," when the moisture inside the kernel is heated and steam builds up pressure inside the kernel. Uniform moisture content in a batch of popcorn kernels ensures uniform popping time, which in turn ensures fewer unpopped kernels. In practice, the percentage of unpopped kernels in a batch can be reduced by sorting popcorn kernels by size.

Which of the following, if true, best helps explain why the percentage of unpopped kernels is lower when popcorn kernels are of uniform size?",(A) The percentage of unpopped kernels can be reduced by increasing cooking time.,"(B) All popcorn kernels, no matter what their size, will pop under proper conditions.
",(C) Yellow popcorn kernels have more moisture content than do white or blue popcorn kernels.,(D) A popcorn kernel's moisture content is fully determined by its size.,"(E) Damaged kernels, another cause of unpopped kernels, have a lower moisture content than intact kernels.",d,"2)Under the modern model for music distribution, musicians sell the right to broadcast their music to companies who give listeners affordable access to large quantities of music.  Some musicians who have been selling their music for many years are displeased with the new model and have seen decreased revenue.  Yet, musicians as a whole are making more money under the new model than they were previously.

Which of the following, if true, would most help to reconcile the apparent conflict?","(A)Some musicians want to make more money than they made under the old model

","(B)Music producers charge higher fees now, leaving less revenue for musicians

","(C)A greater number of musicians sell music now than under the old model

However, after file-sharing networks started to become popular, CD sales actually increased.

Which of the following, if true, best explains the apparent contradictions described above?",(A)File-sharing networks carry a more complete variety of music than most traditional music stories.,(B) The few people using file-sharing networks already purchased more music than most people.,(C)Many people prefer to store their music as computer files rather than maintain large CD collections.,(D)Many consumers have purchased music by artists they discovered through file-sharing networks.,(E)Music available on file-sharing networks is on the same audio quality as music on commercially produced CDs.,d,"3)Two percent of the ocean is coastal ocean-shallow coastal waters in which most fish live. The rest is deep ocean, where less fish live. Much of the garbage burned or dumped on land eventually is deposited in the coastal ocean. To keep coastal ocean free of garbage, therefore, garbage should be dumped in the deep ocean.

Which of the following. if true, constitutes the strongest basis for criticizing the argument above?",(A) Currents far below the ocean's surface bring deep-ocean waters to the coastal ocean.,(B) Deep-ocean dumping would require a substantial change in the processing and packaging of waste.,(C) Hazardous industrial waste has increasingly been dumped illegally into coastal-ocean waters.,(D) There are at present no international agreements regulating dumping in the deep ocean.,(E) The few species of fish that inhabit the deep ocean are of no commercial value.,a,"3)Environmental activists who primarily focus on reducing carbon emissions are misguided. There are many environmental issues that should be of great concern, including some that present more serious challenges than carbon emissions.  Water pollution, for example, has devastating results on the environment.

A trial production run using the new process showed a fifteen percent reduction in costs compared with past performance using the standard process. The production managers therefore concluded that the new process did produce a cost savings.

Which of the following, if true, casts most doubt on the production managers' conclusion?

","(A)In the cost reduction project that eventually led to the trial of the new process, production managers had initially been seeking cost reductions of fifty percent.",(B)Analysis of the trial of the new process showed that the cost reduction during the trial was entirely attributable to a reduction in the number of finished products rejected by quality control.,"(C)While the trial was being conducted, production costs at the factory for a similar product, produced without benefit of the new process, also showed a fifteen percent reduction.","(D)Although some of the factory's managers have been arguing that the product is outdated and ought to be redesigned, the use of the new production process does not involve any changes in the finished product.","(E)Since the new process differs from the standard process only in the way in which the stages of production are organized and ordered, the cost of the materials used in the product is the same in both processes",c,"4)The early universe contained only the lightest elements, hydrogen and helium.

REACT,0020:0025,"5)Passengers must exit airplanes swiftly after accidents, since gases released following accidents are toxic to humans and often explode soon after being released. In order to prevent passenger deaths from gas inhalation, safety officials recommend that passengers be provided with smoke hoods that prevent inhalation of the gases.

Which of the following, if true, constitutes the strongest reason not to require implementation of the safety officials' recommendation?",(A) Test evacuations showed that putting on the smoke hoods added considerably to the overall time it took passengers to leave the cabin.,(B)Some airlines are unwilling to buy the smoke hoods because they consider them to be prohibitively expensive. ,"(C)Although the smoke hoods protect passengers from the toxic gases, they can do nothing to prevent the gases from igniting. ",(D)Some experienced flyers fail to pay attention to the safety instructions given on every commercial flight before takeoff. ,"(E)In many airplane accidents, passengers who were able to reach emergency exits were overcome by toxic gases before they could exit the airplane.",a,"5)Because the number of surgeons is growing faster than the number of operations and because noninvasive medical therapies are increasingly replacing surgery, the average annual number of operations per surgeon has fallen by one-fourth in recent years. It can be concluded that, if these trends continue, a dangerous decline in the level of surgical skill will occur.

The argument above is based on which of the following assumptions?",(A) A surgeon's skill cannot be properly maintained unless the surgeon performs operations with a certain minimum frequency.,(B) Surgeons now spend a large percentage of their time performing noninvasive medical procedures.,"(C) All doctors, but especially surgeons, are receiving poorer training in medical school than they were a few years ago.",(D) The level of skill of each individual surgeon has declined in recent years.,(E) Some experienced surgeons are now performing a greater number of operations than they used to perform.,a,"5)Cities benefit from hosting major sporting events, such as bowl games and major basketball tournaments, but hosting these events also presents challenges. Visitors provide business for hotels, restaurants, and stores, supporting those businesses and increasing tax revenue. On the other hand, with the influx of tourists, police forces and hospitals are often understaffed. Historically, these cities have been able to obtain enough outside workers to sufficiently meet their temporary staffing needs. For that reason, the benefits outweigh the challenges for the cities scheduled to host the next major sporting events.

Which of the following, if true, most undermines the argument?","(A)Increased tourism is not a critical need for the cities hosting the next major sporting events

","(B)There are expected to be more tourists at future major sporting events than there have been at past events

","(C)The cities that will be hosting the next major sporting events are remote and will not be able to obtain any outside workers
