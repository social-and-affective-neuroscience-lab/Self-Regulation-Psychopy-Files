As a result, Dvorak keyboard users are not only able to type more words per minute, but are also less vulnerable to both repetitive stress disorder and carpal tunnel syndrome. Nonetheless, businesses, as well as consumers, have not adopted the Dvorak keyboard. Clearly, if the Dvorak keyboard is to become more widely used, its benefits must be more widely touted.

000:005,REACT,"2) Megalimpet is a nationwide owner of office space.  They have major office buildings in the downtowns of several cities in the 48 lower states, and rent this space to individual companies.  Megalimpet office spaces vary from small office to large suites, and every space has custom-designed wall-to-wall carpeting.  The carpet in several Megalimpet facilities needed replacing.  The winning bid for the nationwide carpet replacement was submitted by Bathyderm Carpet Company (BCC).  The bid contract involves all delivery costs, all installation, and any ongoing maintenance and upkeep while the carpet is under the three-year warranty.  Both BCC executives and independent consultants they hired felt BCC would be able to perform all these services for far less than their bid price; these circumstances would allow BCC to reap a considerable profit.

Which of the following, if true, most calls in question the argument that BCC will make a large profit from this contract with Megalimpet?","(A) All the carpets will have to be transported by train from BCC factory in Louisville, KY, to Megalimpet’s locations from coast to coast.","(B) BCC has already supplied carpets to a number of restaurant chains, and some of those spaces are as large as Megalimpet’s largest office spaces.

",(C) The carpet installation teams will have to cut different sizes of the carpets for the different size office suites in the Megalimpet buildings.,"(D) The material in BCC carpets degrades rapidly when it comes into contact with standard toner, found in most laser printers and photocopiers; the degraded sections are unsightly and smell bad, so they often need to be replaced.","(E) The next competing bid after BCC’s was 50% higher than BCC’s bid

The only source of these compounds in the dolphins' environment is boat paint.  Therefore, since dolphins rid their bodies of the compounds rapidly once exposure ceases, their mortality rate should decline rapidly if such boat paints are banned.

005:0010,REGULATE,"1) The National Farm Administration (NFA) has been concerned over the last decade with the struggles of barley growers.
Plan: In an effort to support these barley growers, two years ago, the NFA began a program of sending them, each autumn, a free special mix of fertilizer and enzymes designed to multiply barley yield, to be applied the following spring during first growth.  This mix had been stunningly successful in multiplying the yield of barley in laboratory conditions.
Results: Most barley growers reported little change in their economic status over this two year period.

Further information: All barley growers received the shipments, and all used them.  Weather conditions have been fair to optimal for barley growth over the past two years.

In light of the further information, which of the following, if true, does most to explain the result that followed the implementation of the plan?","(A) During these two years, most of the barley growers reported using no other fertilizer besides the special mix sent by the government",(B) The trucks that drove the special mix from the depot in Wisconsin to the individual farms sometime took as much as 4 or 5 days.,(C) Some of the enzymes in the special mix multiply the growth of a bacteria that feeds on the young barley plants.,(D) This program was implemented at a time when more than half of barley growers nationwide were reported barely breaking even in their yearly expenses.,"(E) This was the second such NFA program to aid barley growers; the first one, 14 years ago, was started with high hopes, but did little to change their situation.",c,"1) The Green Peas Grocery Store in the remote wealthy enclave of Luxville charges more than the Green Peas Grocery Store in Oak City charges for the same items.

The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?",(A) No one who is a feminist is also politically conservative.,(B)No poet who writes unrhymed or unmetered poetry is politically conservative.,(C)No one who is politically progressive is capable of performing a politically conservative act,(D)Anyone who sometimes writes poetry that is not politically conservative never writes poetry that is politically conservative.,"(E)The content of a poet’s work, not the work’s form, is the most decisive factor in determining what political consequences, if any, the work will have.",c,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,64.41504060011357,None,61.416457100072876,None,66.91711540007964,None,1,1.305115700000897,66.91711540007964,None,66.91711540007964,None,66.91711540007964,None,66.91711540007964,None,66.91711540007964,None,66.91711540007964,None,66.91711540007964,None,68.25155119993724,69.75284279999323,69.76972740003839,None,69.76972740003839,None,69.76972740003839,None,69.76972740003839,None,1,1.5885157999582589,69.76972740003839,None,71.38767830003053,None,return,2.3073456999845803,69.76972740003839,None,72.10530030005611,None,space,0.6450628000311553,72.10530030005611,None,72.8676416000817,None,a,1.8187505998648703,72.8676416000817,75.3241338999942,return,2.409353099996224,72.8676416000817,75.3241338999942,72.8676416000817,None,72.8676416000817,None,72.8676416000817,None,72.8676416000817,None,72.8676416000817,None,75.30742170009762,77.80986759997904,1,001,2019_Dec_05_1338,AcademicSR,3.2.4,60.00124806340307,
005:0010,REGULATE,"2) Linda: In the 1800s, it was found that one in every six women who gave birth in hospitals died of a fever they had contracted after delivering the child and that the mortality was not as high if they gave birth at home with the help of a mid wife. It was found that the doctors had a poorer sense of hygiene and that their dirty hands and instruments were leading to pathogens entering a woman's bloodstream. Thankfully, hygienic conditions today are much better and women are safer.

Fiona: But doctors today are so overworked that a number of doctors, while aware of the need for better hygiene, barely find the time to wash their hands. The likelihood of infections caused by doctors is probably not any better.

Which of the following can be used by Fiona to further establish that Linda need not be correct in her reasoning?","(A) A nationwide survey found that doctors, especially experienced ones, are more prone to the belief that they could not possibly be carrying pathogens.","(B) It is reported that around 50,000 people die every year in our country from hospital acquired infections.",(C ) Compulsory hand cleansing is strictly adhered to by all doctors and nurses before every major surgical procedure.,"(D) During a study, doctors handling newborn babies self reported a hand cleansing rate of 90℅.","(E ) Nurses are not any better than doctors in adhering to strict cleansing schedules, especially when busy.",a,"2) In the years since the city of London imposed strict air-pollution regulations on local industry, the number of bird species seen in and around London has increased dramatically. Similar air-pollution rules should be imposed in other major cities.

Each of the following is an assumption made in the argument above EXCEPT:","(A) In most major cities, air-pollution problems are caused almost entirely by local industry.",(B) Air-pollution regulations on industry have a significant impact on the quality of the air. ,(C)The air-pollution problems of other major cities are basically similar to those once suffered by London. ,(D)An increase in the number of bird species in and around a city is desirable.,(E)The increased sightings of bird species in and around London reflect an actual increase in the number of species in the area. ,a,"2) About two million years ago, lava dammed up a river in western Asia and caused a small lake to form. The lake existed for about half a million years. Bones of an early human ancestor were recently found in the ancient lake-bottom sediments that lie on top of the layer of lava. Therefore, ancestors of modern humans lived in western Asia between two million and one-and-a-half million years ago.

Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?",(A)There were no other lakes in the immediate area before the lava dammed up the river.,(B)The lake contained fish that the human ancestors could have used for food.,(C)The lava that lay under the lake-bottom sediments did not contain any human fossil remains.,(D)The lake was deep enough that a person could drown in it.,(E)The bones were already in the sediments by the time the lake dried up.,e,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,77.89893000014126,77.89893000014126,b,0.5154387000948191,77.89893000014126,79.0438073000405,return,1.1053532999940217,77.89893000014126,79.0438073000405,77.89893000014126,77.89893000014126,77.89893000014126,77.89893000014126,77.89893000014126,77.89893000014126,77.89893000014126,77.89893000014126,77.89893000014126,77.89893000014126,79.02724740002304,81.52935540000908,1,001,2019_Dec_05_1338,AcademicSR,3.2.4,60.00124806340307,
005:0010,REGULATE,"3) The Americans with disabilities act (ADA) was designed to ensure that there is no discrimination against and unfair termination of differently-abled workers in the workplace. However, after the act was introduced, there has been a marked increase in unemployment among the differently-abled.

Which of the following best explains this seeming discrepancy?",(A) A number of differently-abled people chose not to work,"(B)Not willing to deal with the issues of workplace discrimination of the differently-abled, several companies recruited fewer of them in the first place","(C)Knowing that the act was about to be enforced, companies terminated some of the differently-abled while they had a chance",(D)There was no act introduced that would guarantee a job for the differently-abled,(E)The unemployment among the able-bodied has remained consistently high,b,"3) The ancient city of Cephesa was not buried by an eruption of Mt. Amnos is A.D. 310, as some believe. The eruption in the year 310 damaged the city, but it did not destroy it. Cephesa survived for another century before it finally met its destruction in another eruption around A.D. 415. 

Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the author’s claim that the city of Cephesa was not buried by the eruption of Mt. Amnos in A.D. 310?",(A)The city of Cephesa is mentioned in a historical work known to have been written in A.D. 400.,"(B)Coins bearing the image of an emperor who lived around A.D. 410 have been discovered in the ruins of Cephesa, which were preserved by the cinders and ashes that buried the city. ",(C)Geological evidence shows the erruption of Mt. Amnos in A.D. 415 deposited a 10-foot layer of lava on the city of Cephesa  ,(D) Artworks from the city of Cephesa have been found in the ruins of another city known to have been desrtoyed in A.D. 420. ,(E)A hostorical work written in A.D. 430 refers to the eruption of Mt.

Yet Highway Safety Department records show that making use of headlights mandatory at all times does nothing to reduce the overall number of collisions.

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above?","(A)In jurisdictions where use of headlights is optional when visibility is good, one driver in four uses headlights for daytime driving in good weather.",(B)A law making use of headlights mandatory at all times is not especially difficult to enforce.,(C)Only very careful drivers use headlights when their use is not legally required.,(D)There are some jurisdictions in which it is illegal to use headlights when visibility is good.,(E)The jurisdictions where use of headlights is mandatory at all times are those where daytime visibility is frequently poor.,c,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,81.62863739999011,81.62863739999011,c,1.0415185999590904,81.62863739999011,83.43093440006487,return,1.759937700117007,81.62863739999011,83.43093440006487,81.62863739999011,81.62863739999011,81.62863739999011,81.62863739999011,81.62863739999011,81.62863739999011,81.62863739999011,81.62863739999011,81.62863739999011,81.62863739999011,83.41423610015772,85.91671310015954,1,001,2019_Dec_05_1338,AcademicSR,3.2.4,60.00124806340307,
005:0010,REGULATE,"4) In an effort to curb drug abuse, the government has imposed strict laws to prosecute the dealers. However, such an initiative is unlikely to be effective. Prosecuting dealers will lead to a shortage of drugs. At the same time, because no efforts are being taken to curb demand, drugs will be sold at a premium, attracting more people to the very remunerative job of drug dealing. Therefore, to effectively reduce drug abuse, the government will have to prosecute the drug users and not dealers.

Which of the following is the most relevant information in evaluating the credibility of the argument?",(A)Whether efforts have been successfully taken in any other country to regulate drug users.,(B)Whether the payoff from selling drugs outweighs the severity of the punishment,(C)Whether drugs will continue to be sold at a premium when there are dealers in the market again,(D)Whether the majority of the users will be willing to pay a premium to continue to use the drugs,(E)Whether the government will be able to keep track of new dealers as and when they enter the market,d,"4) The burden of maintaining the U.S. highway system falls disproportionately on the trucking industry. Trucks represent only about 10 percent of the vehicles on U.S. roads. Yet road use taxes assessed on trucks amount to almost half the taxes paid for highway upkeep and repair.

Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument above?",(A)The trucking industry has enjoyed record after-tax profits in three of the past four years. ,"(B) Because of their weight, trucks cause over 50 percent of the damage sustained by highway surfaces each year. ","(C) Without an economically viable trucking industry, the cost of goods in the United States would rise significantly.",(D) Road use taxes paid by trucking companies have decreased by 3 percent over the past five years.,"(E)Due to years of neglect, U.S. highways today are badly in need of major repairs and rebuilding. ",b,"4)The Venetian Renaissance painter Vittore Carpaccio used sumptuous reds in most of his paintings. Since the recently discovered Venetian Renaissance painting Erato Declaiming contains notable sumptuous reds, it is probably by Carpaccio.

Which one of the following contains a pattern of flawed reasoning most similar to that in the argument above?","(A)Most Renaissance painters worked in a single medium, either tempera or oil. Since the Renaissance painting Calypso's Bower is in oil, its painter probably always used oil.","(B)In Italian Renaissance painting, the single most common subject was the Virgin and Child, so the single most common subject in Western art probably is also the Virgin and Child.","(C)Works of art in the Renaissance were mostly commissioned by patrons, so the Renaissance work The Dances of Terpsichore was probably commissioned by a patron.","(D)The anonymous painting St. Sebastian is probably an early Florentine painting since it is in tempera, and most early Florentine paintings were in tempera.","(E)Since late-Renaissance paintings were mostly in oil, the Venetian late-Renaissance painter Arnoldi, whose works are now lost, probably painted in oil.",d,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,86.00109270005487,86.00109270005487,c,1.0692308999132365,86.00109270005487,87.65103460010141,return,1.61182969994843,86.00109270005487,87.65103460010141,86.00109270005487,86.00109270005487,86.00109270005487,86.00109270005487,86.00109270005487,86.00109270005487,86.00109270005487,86.00109270005487,86.00109270005487,86.00109270005487,87.63465000013821,90.13661750010215,1,001,2019_Dec_05_1338,AcademicSR,3.2.4,60.00124806340307,
005:0010,REGULATE,"5) Alan: In the last 15 years, most of the criminals who were convicted of theft or murder were from the lower income classes and had not completed high school. Therefore, the government has to spend more money on reducing poverty and increase funding to education. Because terrorism is the most severe of all crimes, such measures would bring down overall crime rate and reduce threat from terrorism.

Dylan: A study that was conducted in a country known to produce a number of terrorists showed that on average the terrorists were better educated than the overall population and that they did not necessarily come from lower income classes. This is probably because crimes such as theft are committed for personal gain while terrorism is for political or religious gain.

Which of the following best describes Dylan's response to Alan?",(A)Dylan changes the direction of the argument entirely by discussing the scenario in a different country,(B)Dylan partially agrees with Alan's reasoning but refutes his recommendation to the government,(C)Dylan converts a causal argument made by Alan into a generalization applicable universally,(D)Dylan challenges Alan's reasoning by explaining why two situations that Alan perceives as similar are not,"(E)While Alan arrives at a conclusion by drawing an analogy, Dylan arrives at the same conclusion by refuting the analogy",d,"5)No nation can long survive unless its people are united by a common tongue. For proof, we need only consider Canada, which is being torn asunder by conflicts between French-speaking Quebec and the other provinces, which are dominated by English speakers.
