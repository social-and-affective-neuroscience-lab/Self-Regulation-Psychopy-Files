000:005,REACT,"1) In order to combat Carville’s rampant homeless problem, Mayor Bloomfield recently proposed a ban on sleeping outdoors in the city’s many parks. He claims that such a measure will force the homeless to either leave Carville or to find means other than sleeping in public parks.

Which of the following, if true, suggests that Mayor Bloomfield’s plan will be successful?","(A) Until the ban, the city’s many homeless shelters were at less than fifty percent occupancy.",(B) Many homeless tend to congregate underneath Carville’s numerous overpasses.,(C) Adjacent cities have even tougher measures on the homeless sleeping outdoors.,"(D) The percent of Carville’s population that has been homeless has been slowly decreasing in the last five years.

","(E) Mayor Jonesmith, Mayor Bloomfield’s predecessor, had been far more tolerant towards the city’s homeless population.",a,"1) The Dvorak keyboard requires less finger movement than the ubiquitous QWERTY keyboard. As a result, Dvorak keyboard users are not only able to type more words per minute, but are also less vulnerable to both repetitive stress disorder and carpal tunnel syndrome. Nonetheless, businesses, as well as consumers, have not adopted the Dvorak keyboard. Clearly, if the Dvorak keyboard is to become more widely used, its benefits must be more widely touted.

 

Which of the following, if true, most threatens the author’s conclusion?",(A)The initial cost of manufacturing a Dvorak keyboard will be more expensive than that of a QWERTY keyboard.,(B)Many who have attempted using a Dvorak keyboard claim that learning the configuration of keys takes weeks.,(C)Those suffering from repetitive stress injuries often attribute the injuries to multiple factors.,"(D)Businesses that have educated employees on the benefits of the Dvorak keyboard, have found that employees continue to use the Qwerty keyboard.",(E)Businesses have found that many employees who believe the Qwerty keyboard is responsible for stress-induced injuries are unaware of the Dvorak keyboard.,d,"1)Executive: We recently ran a set of advertisements in the print version of a travel magazine and on that magazine’s website. We were unable to get any direct information about consumer response to the print ads. However, we found that consumer response to the ads on the website was much more limited than is typical for website ads. We concluded that consumer response to the print ads was probably below par as well.

000:005,REACT,"2) Megalimpet is a nationwide owner of office space.  They have major office buildings in the downtowns of several cities in the 48 lower states, and rent this space to individual companies.  Megalimpet office spaces vary from small office to large suites, and every space has custom-designed wall-to-wall carpeting.  The carpet in several Megalimpet facilities needed replacing.  The winning bid for the nationwide carpet replacement was submitted by Bathyderm Carpet Company (BCC).  The bid contract involves all delivery costs, all installation, and any ongoing maintenance and upkeep while the carpet is under the three-year warranty.  Both BCC executives and independent consultants they hired felt BCC would be able to perform all these services for far less than their bid price; these circumstances would allow BCC to reap a considerable profit.

Which of the following, if true, most calls in question the argument that BCC will make a large profit from this contract with Megalimpet?","(A) All the carpets will have to be transported by train from BCC factory in Louisville, KY, to Megalimpet’s locations from coast to coast.","(B) BCC has already supplied carpets to a number of restaurant chains, and some of those spaces are as large as Megalimpet’s largest office spaces.

",(C) The carpet installation teams will have to cut different sizes of the carpets for the different size office suites in the Megalimpet buildings.,"(D) The material in BCC carpets degrades rapidly when it comes into contact with standard toner, found in most laser printers and photocopiers; the degraded sections are unsightly and smell bad, so they often need to be replaced.","(E) The next competing bid after BCC’s was 50% higher than BCC’s bid

The only source of these compounds in the dolphins' environment is boat paint.  Therefore, since dolphins rid their bodies of the compounds rapidly once exposure ceases, their mortality rate should decline rapidly if such boat paints are banned.

Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 

",(A) The levels of the compounds typically used in boat paints today are lower than they were in boat paints manufactured a decade ago.,"(B) In high concentrations, the compounds are toxic to many types of marine animals.",(C)The compounds break down into harmless substances after a few months of exposure to water or air. ,"(D)High tissue levels of the compounds have recently been found in some marine animals, but there is no recocrd of any of those animals dying in unusually large numbers rececntly ",(E)The compounds do not leach out of the boat paint if the paint is applied exactly in accordance with the manufacturer's directions. ,c,"3)The supernova event of 1987 is interesting in that there is still no evidence of the neutron star that current theory says should have remained after a supernova of that size. This is in spite of the fact that many of the most sensitive instruments ever developed have searched for the tell-tale pulse of radiation that neutron stars emit. Thus, current theory is wrong in claiming that supernovas of a certain size always produce neutron stars.

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?",(A)Most supernova remnants that astronomers have detected have a neutron star nearby.,(B)Sensitive astronomical instruments have detected neutron stars much farther away than the location of the 1987 supernova.,(C)The supernova of 1987 was the first that scientists were able to observe in progress.,(D)Several important features of the 1987 supernova are correctly predicted by the current theory.,(E)Some neutron stars are known to have come into existence by a cause other than a supernova explosion.,b,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29.611567599931732,29.611567599931732,c,1.364868399919942,29.611567599931732,31.415667300112545,return,1.7628645999357104,29.611567599931732,31.415667300112545,29.611567599931732,29.611567599931732,29.611567599931732,29.611567599931732,29.611567599931732,29.611567599931732,29.611567599931732,29.611567599931732,29.611567599931732,29.611567599931732,31.399045099969953,33.90130429994315,,001,2019_Dec_05_1337,AcademicSR,3.2.4,60.10222182561762,

Because deer feed at the edges of the forests, these deer will be attracted to the spaces alongside the new roads. Being cut through Pataska Forest to serve the new residential areas. Consequently, once the housing is occupied, the annual number of the forest's deer hit by cars will be much higher than before construction started. 

Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?",(A)The number of deer hit by commercial vehicles will not increase significantly when the housing is occupied.,(B)Deer will be as attracted to the forest edge around new houses as to the forest edge alongside roads.,"(C)In past years, the annual number of deer that have been hit by cars on existing roads through Pataska Forest has been very low.",(D) The development will leave sufficient forest to sustain a signiificant population of deer.,(E)No deer hunting will be allowed in Pataska Forest when the housing is occupied. ,d,"4)Political scientist: As a political system, democracy does not promote political freedom.

000:005,REACT,"5) In the twentieth century, the visual arts have embarked on major experimentation, from cubism to expressionism.  While tastes always vary, there are certainly some people who find beautiful objects of each of the art movements of the first half of the twentieth century.  In the latter half of the twentieth century, though, most works are so abstract or shocking that neither the critic nor the general public uses the word “beautiful” to describe them: indeed, sometimes late twentieth-century artists have, as one of their expressed goals, the creation of a work that no one could find beautiful.  Whatever these artists are creating may be intellectually engaging at some level, but it is no longer art.",(A) Art critics generally have a different appraisal of a work of art than does the general public.,(B) The meaning of any work of art is defined entirely by the ideas of the artist who created it.,(C) Beauty is a defining quality of art.,(D) All art movements of the latter half of the twentieth century are responses to the movements of the first half of the century.,(E) It is not possible for any work to be simultaneously beautiful and intellectually engaging.,c,"5)The Malbec grape, originally grown in France, has become the main varietal in Argentina. This is surprising because most Malbec grown in Argentina is grown at high altitudes, whereas the Malbec grape once was grown at low altitudes.

A nation with a low average income may still have a substantial middle class better able to pay for new drugs than are many of the poorer citizens of an overall wealthier nation.
