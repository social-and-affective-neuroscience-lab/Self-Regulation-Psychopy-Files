0010:0015,"1)During the last 50 years in England, the national football team has had at least 60℅ of its players born during the months January to March. Similarly, in Germany, at least 50℅ of the team has been born during the first three months of the year. In fact, this statistic holds true for most European countries. This shows that in most European countries, parents with kids born early in the year are more likely to encourage a football career.

Which of the following best explains why the conclusion need not be the best explanation for the statistic?","(A)Of the remaining members, 60℅ or more tend to be born between the months of April and June.",(B)Parents of kids born in the second half of the year have displayed a measurable intent to promote scholarly careers,"(C)The age cut-off for kids to try out for a team in most European countries is calculated as on December 31 of any year and older the kid during trials, greater the chances of getting the right opportunities.",(D)The school year usually begins in April in most European countries and many parents are known to encourage students to work on their academics and not sports during the school year.,"(E)During the last 50 years, on average 30℅ of the kids have been born during the first three months of the year.
",c,"1)As an experienced labor organizer and the former head of one of the nation’s most powerful labor unions, Grayson is an excellent choice to chair the new council on business-labor relations.

Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the conclusion above?",(A) The new council must have the support of the nation's labor leaders if it is to succeed. ,"(B)During his years as a labor leader, Grayson established a record of good relations with business leaders. ",(C)The chair of the new council must be a person who can communicate directly with the leaders of the nation's largest labor unions. ,(D)Most of the other members of the new council will be representatives of business management interests.,(E) An understanding of the needs and problems of labor is the only quallification necessary for the job of chairing the new council. ,e,"1)Biologists attached a radio transmitter to one of a number of wolves that had been released earlier in the White River Wilderness Area as part of a relocation project. The biologists hoped to use this wolf to track the movements of the whole pack. Wolves usually range over a wide area in search of prey, and frequently follow the migrations of their prey animals. The biologists were surprised to find that this particular wolf never moved more than five miles away from the location in which it was first tagged.


Which one of the following, if true, would by itself most help to explain the behavior of the wolf tagged by the biologists?","(A)The area in which the wolves were released was rocky and mountainous, in contrast to the flat, heavily-wooded area from which they were taken. ","(B)The wolf had been tagged and released by the biologists only three miles away from a sheep ranch that provided a large, stable population of prey animals.","(C)The White River Wilderness Area had supported a population of wolves in past years, but they had been hunted to extinction.","(D) Although the wolves in the White River Wilderness Area were under government protection, their numbers had been sharply reduced, within a few years of their release, by illegal hunting.","(E)The wolf captured and tagged by the biologists had split off from the main pack whose movements the biologists had hoped to study, and its movements did not represent those of the main pack.",b,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,9.593732599983923,None,12.63269549998222,None,1,1.2974015999934636,12.63269549998222,None,12.63269549998222,None,12.63269549998222,None,12.63269549998222,None,12.63269549998222,None,12.63269549998222,None,12.63269549998222,None,13.946752499963623,15.44844369997736,15.486415899998974,None,15.486415899998974,None,15.486415899998974,None,15.486415899998974,None,2,0.7313834000378847,15.486415899998974,None,17.46692666995805,None,return,1.9617272000177763,15.486415899998974,None,17.616956699988805,None,a,1.8008567000506446,17.616956699988805,22.887588499987032,return,5.222781100019347,17.616956699988805,22.887588499987032,17.616956699988805,None,17.616956699988805,None,17.616956699988805,None,17.616956699988805,None,17.616956699988805,None,22.870931399986148,24.372571599960793,,001,2019_Oct_28_1143,AcademicSR,3.2.4,60.22050337762655,
