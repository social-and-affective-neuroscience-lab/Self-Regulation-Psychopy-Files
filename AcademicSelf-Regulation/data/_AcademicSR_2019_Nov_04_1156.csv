005:0010,"1) The National Farm Administration (NFA) has been concerned over the last decade with the struggles of barley growers.
Plan: In an effort to support these barley growers, two years ago, the NFA began a program of sending them, each autumn, a free special mix of fertilizer and enzymes designed to multiply barley yield, to be applied the following spring during first growth.  This mix had been stunningly successful in multiplying the yield of barley in laboratory conditions.
Results: Most barley growers reported little change in their economic status over this two year period.

Further information: All barley growers received the shipments, and all used them.  Weather conditions have been fair to optimal for barley growth over the past two years.

In light of the further information, which of the following, if true, does most to explain the result that followed the implementation of the plan?","(A) During these two years, most of the barley growers reported using no other fertilizer besides the special mix sent by the government",(B) The trucks that drove the special mix from the depot in Wisconsin to the individual farms sometime took as much as 4 or 5 days.,(C) Some of the enzymes in the special mix multiply the growth of a bacteria that feeds on the young barley plants.,(D) This program was implemented at a time when more than half of barley growers nationwide were reported barely breaking even in their yearly expenses.,"(E) This was the second such NFA program to aid barley growers; the first one, 14 years ago, was started with high hopes, but did little to change their situation.",c,"1) The Green Peas Grocery Store in the remote wealthy enclave of Luxville charges more than the Green Peas Grocery Store in Oak City charges for the same items. Clearly, on any given item, the Green Peas grocery franchise is taking advantage of its location in Luxville to reap higher profits on that item.

In evaluating the argument, it would be most useful to compare",(A) the selection of specialty items in the Oak City location with the selection of specialty items in the Luxville location.,(B)the cost of transporting merchandise to the Oak City location with the comparable cost to the Luxville location.,(C) the average cost of the same or comparable items at other grocery stores in Oak City with the average cost at other stores in Luxville.,(D)the percent of average household income spent on groceries in Oak City with the comparable percentage in Luxville.,(E) the cost of these items in Oak City and in Luxville with the cost at other Green Peas stores throughout the state.,b,"1)Several critics have claimed that any contemporary poet who writes formal poetry—poetry that is rhymed and metered—is performing a politically conservative act. This is plainly false. Consider Molly Peacock and Marilyn Hacker, two contemporary poets whose poetry is almost exclusively formal and yet who are themselves politically progressive feminists.

The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?",(A) No one who is a feminist is also politically conservative.,(B)No poet who writes unrhymed or unmetered poetry is politically conservative.,(C)No one who is politically progressive is capable of performing a politically conservative act,(D)Anyone who sometimes writes poetry that is not politically conservative never writes poetry that is politically conservative.,"(E)The content of a poet’s work, not the work’s form, is the most decisive factor in determining what political consequences, if any, the work will have.",c,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,8.149645500001498,None,11.208121199975722,None,1,1.4462553999619558,11.208121199975722,None,11.208121199975722,None,11.208121199975722,None,11.208121199975722,None,11.208121199975722,None,11.208121199975722,None,11.208121199975722,None,12.68401599995559,14.185226099973079,14.228406499954872,None,14.228406499954872,None,14.228406499954872,None,14.228406499954872,None,3,4.361698799999431,14.228406499954872,None,23.292903019988444,None,return,9.048514600028284,14.228406499954872,None,23.428866799979005,None,a,38.39423169998918,23.428866799979005,62.80885329999728,return,39.33566639997298,23.428866799979005,62.80885329999728,23.428866799979005,None,23.428866799979005,None,23.428866799979005,None,23.428866799979005,None,23.428866799979005,None,62.79222589998972,65.29418749996694,,001,2019_Nov_04_1156,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.97659712815448,
005:0010,"2) Linda: In the 1800s, it was found that one in every six women who gave birth in hospitals died of a fever they had contracted after delivering the child and that the mortality was not as high if they gave birth at home with the help of a mid wife. It was found that the doctors had a poorer sense of hygiene and that their dirty hands and instruments were leading to pathogens entering a woman's bloodstream. Thankfully, hygienic conditions today are much better and women are safer.

Fiona: But doctors today are so overworked that a number of doctors, while aware of the need for better hygiene, barely find the time to wash their hands. The likelihood of infections caused by doctors is probably not any better.

Which of the following can be used by Fiona to further establish that Linda need not be correct in her reasoning?","(A) A nationwide survey found that doctors, especially experienced ones, are more prone to the belief that they could not possibly be carrying pathogens.","(B) It is reported that around 50,000 people die every year in our country from hospital acquired infections.",(C ) Compulsory hand cleansing is strictly adhered to by all doctors and nurses before every major surgical procedure.,"(D) During a study, doctors handling newborn babies self reported a hand cleansing rate of 90℅.","(E ) Nurses are not any better than doctors in adhering to strict cleansing schedules, especially when busy.",a,"2) In the years since the city of London imposed strict air-pollution regulations on local industry, the number of bird species seen in and around London has increased dramatically. Similar air-pollution rules should be imposed in other major cities.

Each of the following is an assumption made in the argument above EXCEPT:","(A) In most major cities, air-pollution problems are caused almost entirely by local industry.",(B) Air-pollution regulations on industry have a significant impact on the quality of the air. ,(C)The air-pollution problems of other major cities are basically similar to those once suffered by London. ,(D)An increase in the number of bird species in and around a city is desirable.,(E)The increased sightings of bird species in and around London reflect an actual increase in the number of species in the area. ,a,"2) About two million years ago, lava dammed up a river in western Asia and caused a small lake to form. The lake existed for about half a million years. Bones of an early human ancestor were recently found in the ancient lake-bottom sediments that lie on top of the layer of lava. Therefore, ancestors of modern humans lived in western Asia between two million and one-and-a-half million years ago.

Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?",(A)There were no other lakes in the immediate area before the lava dammed up the river.,(B)The lake contained fish that the human ancestors could have used for food.,(C)The lava that lay under the lake-bottom sediments did not contain any human fossil remains.,(D)The lake was deep enough that a person could drown in it.,(E)The bones were already in the sediments by the time the lake dried up.,e,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,65.38810969999759,65.38810969999759,c,121.20204020000529,65.38810969999759,187.328832899977,return,121.90490550000686,65.38810969999759,187.328832899977,65.38810969999759,65.38810969999759,65.38810969999759,65.38810969999759,65.38810969999759,65.38810969999759,65.38810969999759,65.38810969999759,65.38810969999759,65.38810969999759,187.312402200012,189.81413809995865,,001,2019_Nov_04_1156,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.97659712815448,
005:0010,"3) The Americans with disabilities act (ADA) was designed to ensure that there is no discrimination against and unfair termination of differently-abled workers in the workplace. However, after the act was introduced, there has been a marked increase in unemployment among the differently-abled.

Which of the following best explains this seeming discrepancy?",(A) A number of differently-abled people chose not to work,"(B)Not willing to deal with the issues of workplace discrimination of the differently-abled, several companies recruited fewer of them in the first place","(C)Knowing that the act was about to be enforced, companies terminated some of the differently-abled while they had a chance",(D)There was no act introduced that would guarantee a job for the differently-abled,(E)The unemployment among the able-bodied has remained consistently high,b,"3) The ancient city of Cephesa was not buried by an eruption of Mt. Amnos is A.D. 310, as some believe. The eruption in the year 310 damaged the city, but it did not destroy it. Cephesa survived for another century before it finally met its destruction in another eruption around A.D. 415. 

Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the author’s claim that the city of Cephesa was not buried by the eruption of Mt. Amnos in A.D. 310?",(A)The city of Cephesa is mentioned in a historical work known to have been written in A.D. 400.,"(B)Coins bearing the image of an emperor who lived around A.D. 410 have been discovered in the ruins of Cephesa, which were preserved by the cinders and ashes that buried the city. ",(C)Geological evidence shows the erruption of Mt. Amnos in A.D. 415 deposited a 10-foot layer of lava on the city of Cephesa  ,(D) Artworks from the city of Cephesa have been found in the ruins of another city known to have been desrtoyed in A.D. 420. ,(E)A hostorical work written in A.D. 430 refers to the eruption of Mt. Amnos in A.D. 415,b,"3)In jurisdictions where use of headlights is optional when visibility is good, drivers who use headlights at all times are less likely to be involved in a collision than are drivers who use headlights only when visibility is poor. Yet Highway Safety Department records show that making use of headlights mandatory at all times does nothing to reduce the overall number of collisions.

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above?","(A)In jurisdictions where use of headlights is optional when visibility is good, one driver in four uses headlights for daytime driving in good weather.",(B)A law making use of headlights mandatory at all times is not especially difficult to enforce.,(C)Only very careful drivers use headlights when their use is not legally required.,(D)There are some jurisdictions in which it is illegal to use headlights when visibility is good.,(E)The jurisdictions where use of headlights is mandatory at all times are those where daytime visibility is frequently poor.,c,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,189.91924369998742,189.91924369998742,c,45.2797027999768,189.91924369998742,238.6548746000044,return,48.70104329998139,189.91924369998742,238.6548746000044,189.91924369998742,189.91924369998742,189.91924369998742,189.91924369998742,189.91924369998742,189.91924369998742,189.91924369998742,189.91924369998742,189.91924369998742,189.91924369998742,238.63819099997636,241.14030349999666,,001,2019_Nov_04_1156,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.97659712815448,
005:0010,"4) In an effort to curb drug abuse, the government has imposed strict laws to prosecute the dealers. However, such an initiative is unlikely to be effective. Prosecuting dealers will lead to a shortage of drugs. At the same time, because no efforts are being taken to curb demand, drugs will be sold at a premium, attracting more people to the very remunerative job of drug dealing. Therefore, to effectively reduce drug abuse, the government will have to prosecute the drug users and not dealers.

Which of the following is the most relevant information in evaluating the credibility of the argument?",(A)Whether efforts have been successfully taken in any other country to regulate drug users.,(B)Whether the payoff from selling drugs outweighs the severity of the punishment,(C)Whether drugs will continue to be sold at a premium when there are dealers in the market again,(D)Whether the majority of the users will be willing to pay a premium to continue to use the drugs,(E)Whether the government will be able to keep track of new dealers as and when they enter the market,d,"4) The burden of maintaining the U.S. highway system falls disproportionately on the trucking industry. Trucks represent only about 10 percent of the vehicles on U.S. roads. Yet road use taxes assessed on trucks amount to almost half the taxes paid for highway upkeep and repair.

Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument above?",(A)The trucking industry has enjoyed record after-tax profits in three of the past four years. ,"(B) Because of their weight, trucks cause over 50 percent of the damage sustained by highway surfaces each year. ","(C) Without an economically viable trucking industry, the cost of goods in the United States would rise significantly.",(D) Road use taxes paid by trucking companies have decreased by 3 percent over the past five years.,"(E)Due to years of neglect, U.S. highways today are badly in need of major repairs and rebuilding. ",b,"4)The Venetian Renaissance painter Vittore Carpaccio used sumptuous reds in most of his paintings. Since the recently discovered Venetian Renaissance painting Erato Declaiming contains notable sumptuous reds, it is probably by Carpaccio.

Which one of the following contains a pattern of flawed reasoning most similar to that in the argument above?","(A)Most Renaissance painters worked in a single medium, either tempera or oil. Since the Renaissance painting Calypso's Bower is in oil, its painter probably always used oil.","(B)In Italian Renaissance painting, the single most common subject was the Virgin and Child, so the single most common subject in Western art probably is also the Virgin and Child.","(C)Works of art in the Renaissance were mostly commissioned by patrons, so the Renaissance work The Dances of Terpsichore was probably commissioned by a patron.","(D)The anonymous painting St. Sebastian is probably an early Florentine painting since it is in tempera, and most early Florentine paintings were in tempera.","(E)Since late-Renaissance paintings were mostly in oil, the Venetian late-Renaissance painter Arnoldi, whose works are now lost, probably painted in oil.",d,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,241.2574341999716,241.2574341999716,c,152.96461859997362,241.2574341999716,395.05136529996525,return,153.7468324000365,241.2574341999716,395.05136529996525,241.2574341999716,241.2574341999716,241.2574341999716,241.2574341999716,241.2574341999716,241.2574341999716,241.2574341999716,241.2574341999716,241.2574341999716,241.2574341999716,395.03479309997056,397.5365695999935,,001,2019_Nov_04_1156,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.97659712815448,
005:0010,"5) Alan: In the last 15 years, most of the criminals who were convicted of theft or murder were from the lower income classes and had not completed high school. Therefore, the government has to spend more money on reducing poverty and increase funding to education. Because terrorism is the most severe of all crimes, such measures would bring down overall crime rate and reduce threat from terrorism.

Dylan: A study that was conducted in a country known to produce a number of terrorists showed that on average the terrorists were better educated than the overall population and that they did not necessarily come from lower income classes. This is probably because crimes such as theft are committed for personal gain while terrorism is for political or religious gain.

Which of the following best describes Dylan's response to Alan?",(A)Dylan changes the direction of the argument entirely by discussing the scenario in a different country,(B)Dylan partially agrees with Alan's reasoning but refutes his recommendation to the government,(C)Dylan converts a causal argument made by Alan into a generalization applicable universally,(D)Dylan challenges Alan's reasoning by explaining why two situations that Alan perceives as similar are not,"(E)While Alan arrives at a conclusion by drawing an analogy, Dylan arrives at the same conclusion by refuting the analogy",d,"5)No nation can long survive unless its people are united by a common tongue. For proof, we need only consider Canada, which is being torn asunder by conflicts between French-speaking Quebec and the other provinces, which are dominated by English speakers.

Which of the following, if true, most effectively challenges the author’s conclusion?",(A)Conflicts over language have led to violent clashes between the Basque-speaking minority in Spain and the Spanish-speaking majority. ,(B)Proposals to declare English the official language of the United States have met with resistance from members of Hispanic and other minority groups. ,"(C)Economic and political differences, along with linguistic ones, have contributed to the provincial conflicts in Canada.","(D)The public of India, in existence since 1948, has a population that speaks hundreds of different, though related, languages.

Life expectancy for women has - for the first time - surpassed that for men and while only around 20℅ of college students in the late 1800s were women, today, almost 60℅ of college students are women.

Sam: However, women educated in the top-ranked colleges in the country earn only about 70℅ of what their male counterparts earn. Also, studies show that even today, in a number of industries, women are refused top management positions simply because they are women.

Which of the following is Jess most likely to say in response to Sam?","(A)Women today are healthier and live longer than women in the 1800s, who primarily died because of child birth.",(B)There are more women at the entry-level jobs of most industries than there are men.,(C)Women today are better able to juggle professional and personal lives and a number of them are proving to be successful single mothers.,(D)The proportion of women in the judicial and legislative branches of the country is at its highest and the country elected its first woman president recently.,(E)Women are allowed more freedom today and are not likely to be sacrificed at the altar of marriage or in a witch hunt.,d,"1) Unlike the lungs and the kidneys, the liver is an organ well suited for living-donor transplants to children because the portion of the liver must be removed from a healthy adult to replace the diseased liver of a child will be regenerated in the healthy adult within a few months.

This fact likely comes as a surprise to some because standards are higher than ever.  Employers demand higher degrees than before and more workers have bachelor's and master's degrees than at any other time.  Higher degrees do not mean more competent workers, however.  Recent evidence indicates that modern workers have poor writing ability, lack focus, and are inept at personal communication.

Which of the following, if true, most undermines the argument?","(A)Modern workers generally work more hours than workers in the past

","(B)Workers of the past often obtained bachelor's and master's degrees

","(C)Workers of the past had poor writing ability, lacked focus, and were inept at personal communication

","(D)In the past, it was often more difficult to obtain a bachelor's or master's degree

Each of the following, if true, cast doubt on the author's argument about artistic success for actors EXCEPT:",(A)The figures for the number of classes taken were based solely on information provided by actors.,(B)Success as an actor cannot necessarily be judged exclusively by recent credits.,"(C)For most successful actors, it's not the quantity but the quality of their classes that has helped to develop their craft",(D)There is no relationship between the number of professional productions in which an actor has appeared and true artistic success.,(E)Most successful actors have taken only a small number of intensive classes.,a,"2) Popcorn kernels explode, or "pop," when the moisture inside the kernel is heated and steam builds up pressure inside the kernel. Uniform moisture content in a batch of popcorn kernels ensures uniform popping time, which in turn ensures fewer unpopped kernels. In practice, the percentage of unpopped kernels in a batch can be reduced by sorting popcorn kernels by size.

Which of the following, if true, best helps explain why the percentage of unpopped kernels is lower when popcorn kernels are of uniform size?",(A) The percentage of unpopped kernels can be reduced by increasing cooking time.,"(B) All popcorn kernels, no matter what their size, will pop under proper conditions.
",(C) Yellow popcorn kernels have more moisture content than do white or blue popcorn kernels.,(D) A popcorn kernel's moisture content is fully determined by its size.,"(E) Damaged kernels, another cause of unpopped kernels, have a lower moisture content than intact kernels.",d,"2)Under the modern model for music distribution, musicians sell the right to broadcast their music to companies who give listeners affordable access to large quantities of music.  Some musicians who have been selling their music for many years are displeased with the new model and have seen decreased revenue.  Yet, musicians as a whole are making more money under the new model than they were previously.

Which of the following, if true, would most help to reconcile the apparent conflict?","(A)Some musicians want to make more money than they made under the old model

","(B)Music producers charge higher fees now, leaving less revenue for musicians

","(C)A greater number of musicians sell music now than under the old model

A trial production run using the new process showed a fifteen percent reduction in costs compared with past performance using the standard process. The production managers therefore concluded that the new process did produce a cost savings.

Which of the following, if true, casts most doubt on the production managers' conclusion?

","(A)In the cost reduction project that eventually led to the trial of the new process, production managers had initially been seeking cost reductions of fifty percent.",(B)Analysis of the trial of the new process showed that the cost reduction during the trial was entirely attributable to a reduction in the number of finished products rejected by quality control.,"(C)While the trial was being conducted, production costs at the factory for a similar product, produced without benefit of the new process, also showed a fifteen percent reduction.","(D)Although some of the factory's managers have been arguing that the product is outdated and ought to be redesigned, the use of the new production process does not involve any changes in the finished product.","(E)Since the new process differs from the standard process only in the way in which the stages of production are organized and ordered, the cost of the materials used in the product is the same in both processes",c,"4)The early universe contained only the lightest elements, hydrogen and helium.

In order to prevent passenger deaths from gas inhalation, safety officials recommend that passengers be provided with smoke hoods that prevent inhalation of the gases.

Which of the following, if true, constitutes the strongest reason not to require implementation of the safety officials' recommendation?",(A) Test evacuations showed that putting on the smoke hoods added considerably to the overall time it took passengers to leave the cabin.,(B)Some airlines are unwilling to buy the smoke hoods because they consider them to be prohibitively expensive. ,"(C)Although the smoke hoods protect passengers from the toxic gases, they can do nothing to prevent the gases from igniting.

It can be concluded that, if these trends continue, a dangerous decline in the level of surgical skill will occur.

The argument above is based on which of the following assumptions?",(A) A surgeon's skill cannot be properly maintained unless the surgeon performs operations with a certain minimum frequency.,(B) Surgeons now spend a large percentage of their time performing noninvasive medical procedures.,"(C) All doctors, but especially surgeons, are receiving poorer training in medical school than they were a few years ago.",(D) The level of skill of each individual surgeon has declined in recent years.,(E) Some experienced surgeons are now performing a greater number of operations than they used to perform.,a,"5)Cities benefit from hosting major sporting events, such as bowl games and major basketball tournaments, but hosting these events also presents challenges. Visitors provide business for hotels, restaurants, and stores, supporting those businesses and increasing tax revenue. On the other hand, with the influx of tourists, police forces and hospitals are often understaffed. Historically, these cities have been able to obtain enough outside workers to sufficiently meet their temporary staffing needs. For that reason, the benefits outweigh the challenges for the cities scheduled to host the next major sporting events.

Which of the following, if true, most undermines the argument?","(A)Increased tourism is not a critical need for the cities hosting the next major sporting events

","(B)There are expected to be more tourists at future major sporting events than there have been at past events

Which of the following best explains the apparent paradox?",(A)The city does not pay welfare unless the applicants have at least some things working for them,(B)Claiming that they do not have a car or a TV ensures that the city looks at the applicant more favorably,"(C)While the applicants may be willing to accept that they don't have certain things, they felt embarrassed having to accept that they don't have most things.","(D)Historically, at least 30℅ of the claims have had people understating what they have while only 22℅ overstated what they had.",(E)The people who understated what they had were not the same people who overstated what they had,c,"4) The U.S. census is not perfect: thousands of Americans probably go uncounted. However, the basic statistical portrait of the nation painted by the census is accurate. Certainly some of the poor go uncounted, particularly the homeless; but some of the rich go uncounted as well, because they are often abroad or traveling between one residence and another.

Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument above depends?",(A) Both the rich and the poor have personal and economic reasons to avoid being counted by the census. ,(B)All Americans may reasonably be classified as either rich or poor. ,(C) The percentage of poor Americans uncounted by the census is close to the percentage of rich Americans uncounted. ,(D) The number of homeless Americans is approximately equal to the number of rich Americans. ,(E)The primary purpose of the census is to analyze the economic status of the American population. ,c,"4)Two things are true of all good deeds. First, they are accompanied by feelings of satisfaction. Second, if they are publicly known, they elicit general approval.

If all of the above statements are true, then which of the following cannot also be true?

",(A)Some publicly known deeds that elicit general approval are not accompanied by feelings of satisfaction.,"(B)Even if they frequently elicit general approval when known publicly, some deeds that are accompanied by feelings of satisfaction are not good deeds.",(C)Good deeds are good solely because they are accompanied by feelings of satisfaction.,(D)Every publicly known act that is accompanied by feelings of satisfaction is a good deed.,(E)Good deeds are good solely because they are accompanied by feelings of satisfaction.,a,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,3,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,805.0754373999662,805.0754373999662,e,41.354652800015174,805.0754373999662,847.0930120999692,return,41.977139899972826,805.0754373999662,847.0930120999692,805.0754373999662,805.0754373999662,805.0754373999662,805.0754373999662,805.0754373999662,805.0754373999662,805.0754373999662,805.0754373999662,805.0754373999662,805.0754373999662,847.0763769999612,849.5783736999729,,001,2019_Nov_04_1156,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.97659712815448,
0010:0015,"5) Terrorist attacks invariably lead to tremendous losses in life, property, and morale of a country. The effects of a terrorist attack are not just immediate and can have long-lasting, trickle-down effects as well. The fear, for example, takes a long time to die down. However, some of these repercussions can be beneficial to the country. Take for instance, the recent terrorist attack on our capital city. In the weeks following the attack, the crime rate in the city came down significantly from what it was just before the attack. This must primarily be due to the increased presence of police resources that were moved to the area and is thus an indirect effect of the attack.

Which of the following options gives one more option as to why the crime rate decreased because of the terrorist attacks?",(A)The capital city is under increased monitoring leading to quick detection of crimes - many times while the crime is still underway.,(B)A number of people are frightened because of the terrorist attacks and have fled the capital city.,(C)There was a recorded decrease in crime rate right after the terrorist attack in almost all cities of the country.,(D)Intel reports show that the terrorists who pulled off the attack had been committing various other smaller crimes regularly to distract law enforcement from their true purposes.,(E)The government had initiated schemes to decrease poverty and provide better livelihood for the people just before the terrorist attack.,d,"5) Some commentators complain that a “litigation explosion” in the past decade has led to unreasonably high costs for U.S. businesses by encouraging more product liability suits against manufacturers. However, these complaints are based mainly on myth. Statistics show that the number of successful product liability suits has remained almost the same, and the average sum awarded in damages has grown no faster than the inflation rate.

Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument above?","(A)The number of unsuccessful suits has skyrocketed, imposing huge new legal expenses on businesses. ",(B)Several of the largest awards ever made in product liability cases occurred within the last two years. ,(C)The rise of the consumer movement has encouraged citizens to seek legal redress for product flaws. ,"(D) Lawyers often undertake product liability cases on a contingency basis, so their payment is based on the size of the damages awarded.",(E)) Juries often award damages in product liability suits out of emotional sympathy for an injured consumer. ,a,"5)Many home renters buy their first homes believing that it is clearly more profitable to make mortgage payments than to pay rent. Other costs, such as maintenance, property taxes, and insurance must be factored in, however. All housing expenses together total at least 40% of most homeowners' income.  It is not financially reasonable to spend any more than 30% of income on housing expenses.",(A)A minority of homeowners have reasonable housing expenses,(B)A majority of renters pay an unreasonable amount for housing expenses,(C)A majority of homeowners have unreasonable housing expenses,(D)A minority of homeowners have unreasonable housing expenses,"(E)The combination of property taxes, insurance, and home maintenance costs is greater than mortgage payments for a minority of homeowners",d,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,4,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,849.7030741999624,849.7030741999624,d,55.07884319999721,849.7030741999624,906.6257111000014,return,56.885659499967005,849.7030741999624,906.6257111000014,849.7030741999624,849.7030741999624,849.7030741999624,849.7030741999624,849.7030741999624,849.7030741999624,849.7030741999624,849.7030741999624,849.7030741999624,849.7030741999624,906.6089812999708,909.1110985999694,,001,2019_Nov_04_1156,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.97659712815448,
