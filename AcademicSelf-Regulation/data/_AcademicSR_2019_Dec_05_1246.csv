REGULATE,0020:0025,"1) Jess: To be a woman in this century is far better than to be a woman in centuries past. Life expectancy for women has - for the first time - surpassed that for men and while only around 20℅ of college students in the late 1800s were women, today, almost 60℅ of college students are women.

Sam: However, women educated in the top-ranked colleges in the country earn only about 70℅ of what their male counterparts earn. Also, studies show that even today, in a number of industries, women are refused top management positions simply because they are women.

Which of the following is Jess most likely to say in response to Sam?","(A)Women today are healthier and live longer than women in the 1800s, who primarily died because of child birth.",(B)There are more women at the entry-level jobs of most industries than there are men.,(C)Women today are better able to juggle professional and personal lives and a number of them are proving to be successful single mothers.,(D)The proportion of women in the judicial and legislative branches of the country is at its highest and the country elected its first woman president recently.,(E)Women are allowed more freedom today and are not likely to be sacrificed at the altar of marriage or in a witch hunt.,d,"1) Unlike the lungs and the kidneys, the liver is an organ well suited for living-donor transplants to children because the portion of the liver must be removed from a healthy adult to replace the diseased liver of a child will be regenerated in the healthy adult within a few months.

Which of the following, if true, provides the most additional support for the conclusion drawn above?",(A)  The success rate of liver transplants is slightly lower in children than in adults.,"(B) In removing the portion of liver for transplant there is danger of causing damage to the spleen of the donor, and that could necessitate the removal of the spleen.",(C) There is less danger that a transplanted organ will be rejected when the organ donor is a close relative of the recipient.,(D) There are so few suitable donors that about one-half of the babies with liver disease born in the United States each year die before they can receive a liver transplant.,"(E)Each lobe of the liver functions separately, and it is possible to extract a portion of one lobe without disrupting critical liver functions.",e,"1)Modern workers are less competent than workers of the past.  This fact likely comes as a surprise to some because standards are higher than ever.  Employers demand higher degrees than before and more workers have bachelor's and master's degrees than at any other time.  Higher degrees do not mean more competent workers, however.  Recent evidence indicates that modern workers have poor writing ability, lack focus, and are inept at personal communication.

Which of the following, if true, most undermines the argument?","(A)Modern workers generally work more hours than workers in the past

","(B)Workers of the past often obtained bachelor's and master's degrees

","(C)Workers of the past had poor writing ability, lacked focus, and were inept at personal communication

","(D)In the past, it was often more difficult to obtain a bachelor's or master's degree

","(E)Modern workers are dismissed from their jobs less frequently than at any other time
