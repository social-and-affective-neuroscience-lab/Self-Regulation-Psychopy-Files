0010:0015,"1)During the last 50 years in England, the national football team has had at least 60℅ of its players born during the months January to March. Similarly, in Germany, at least 50℅ of the team has been born during the first three months of the year. In fact, this statistic holds true for most European countries. This shows that in most European countries, parents with kids born early in the year are more likely to encourage a football career.

Which of the following best explains why the conclusion need not be the best explanation for the statistic?","(A)Of the remaining members, 60℅ or more tend to be born between the months of April and June.",(B)Parents of kids born in the second half of the year have displayed a measurable intent to promote scholarly careers,"(C)The age cut-off for kids to try out for a team in most European countries is calculated as on December 31 of any year and older the kid during trials, greater the chances of getting the right opportunities.",(D)The school year usually begins in April in most European countries and many parents are known to encourage students to work on their academics and not sports during the school year.,"(E)During the last 50 years, on average 30℅ of the kids have been born during the first three months of the year.

",(C)The chair of the new council must be a person who can communicate directly with the leaders of the nation's largest labor unions. ,(D)Most of the other members of the new council will be representatives of business management interests.,(E) An understanding of the needs and problems of labor is the only quallification necessary for the job of chairing the new council. ,e,"1)Biologists attached a radio transmitter to one of a number of wolves that had been released earlier in the White River Wilderness Area as part of a relocation project. The biologists hoped to use this wolf to track the movements of the whole pack. Wolves usually range over a wide area in search of prey, and frequently follow the migrations of their prey animals. The biologists were surprised to find that this particular wolf never moved more than five miles away from the location in which it was first tagged.


Which one of the following, if true, would by itself most help to explain the behavior of the wolf tagged by the biologists?","(A)The area in which the wolves were released was rocky and mountainous, in contrast to the flat, heavily-wooded area from which they were taken. ","(B)The wolf had been tagged and released by the biologists only three miles away from a sheep ranch that provided a large, stable population of prey animals.","(C)The White River Wilderness Area had supported a population of wolves in past years, but they had been hunted to extinction.","(D) Although the wolves in the White River Wilderness Area were under government protection, their numbers had been sharply reduced, within a few years of their release, by illegal hunting.","(E)The wolf captured and tagged by the biologists had split off from the main pack whose movements the biologists had hoped to study, and its movements did not represent those of the main pack.",b,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,9.331516200036276,None,12.382503900036681,None,1,0.8871412000153214,12.382503900036681,None,12.382503900036681,None,12.382503900036681,None,12.382503900036681,None,12.382503900036681,None,12.382503900036681,None,12.382503900036681,None,13.285009299986996,14.786228800017852,14.82506539998576,None,14.82506539998576,None,14.82506539998576,None,14.82506539998576,None,2,1.2931954999803565,14.82506539998576,None,16.454188710002928,None,return,1.6109830000204965,14.82506539998576,None,16.604577200021595,None,a,2.905081600008998,16.604577200021595,22.02557599998545,return,5.384643000026699,16.604577200021595,22.02557599998545,16.604577200021595,None,16.604577200021595,None,16.604577200021595,None,16.604577200021595,None,16.604577200021595,None,22.009055700036697,24.510934500023723,,001,2019_Oct_28_1149,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.89637925582791,
0010:0015,"2) Studies have established that children who watched 2 more hours of TV on an average daily basis during the first 15 years of their life were 50℅ more likely to be arrested for property crimes in the country. Researchers believe that these studies clearly establish that violence in movies and TV contribute to aggressive behavior in real life. On the other hand, there is no clear evidence that the programs that the kids watched on TV were violent in the first place. Even if we were to accept that TV watching contributed to the increased crime rate, it need not have been because of the nature of the programs. Perhaps, children who watched programs such as Adams and Samson, a funny sit-com about two blundering cops began perceiving all cops as incompetent.

0010:0015,"3) During medieval times, the administrative system was organized such that jobs were traditionally held within the same family. The eldest son of the village's blacksmith will take up his father’s business and become the next blacksmith. The other sons would join the army or serve the king in some fashion while the daughters did what their mother did. Although the world has undergone innumerable changes, the dynastic system has not undergone any change whatsoever. Children who have fathers who played major league baseball are 800 times more likely than other kids to become major league players themselves.

0010:0015,"4) A survey conducted recently in the city indicated that most college welfare-aid applicants understate the number of luxury items - such as cars and TVs – that their family owned, in an effort to maximize the amount of aid they can claim from the city. Paradoxically, the same study also found that many applicants claimed that they had running water and a gas connection even when they did not.

However, the basic statistical portrait of the nation painted by the census is accurate. Certainly some of the poor go uncounted, particularly the homeless; but some of the rich go uncounted as well, because they are often abroad or traveling between one residence and another.

Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument above depends?",(A) Both the rich and the poor have personal and economic reasons to avoid being counted by the census. ,(B)All Americans may reasonably be classified as either rich or poor. ,(C) The percentage of poor Americans uncounted by the census is close to the percentage of rich Americans uncounted. ,(D) The number of homeless Americans is approximately equal to the number of rich Americans. ,(E)The primary purpose of the census is to analyze the economic status of the American population. ,c,"4)Two things are true of all good deeds.

0010:0015,"5) Terrorist attacks invariably lead to tremendous losses in life, property, and morale of a country. The effects of a terrorist attack are not just immediate and can have long-lasting, trickle-down effects as well. The fear, for example, takes a long time to die down. However, some of these repercussions can be beneficial to the country. Take for instance, the recent terrorist attack on our capital city. In the weeks following the attack, the crime rate in the city came down significantly from what it was just before the attack. This must primarily be due to the increased presence of police resources that were moved to the area and is thus an indirect effect of the attack.

Which of the following options gives one more option as to why the crime rate decreased because of the terrorist attacks?",(A)The capital city is under increased monitoring leading to quick detection of crimes - many times while the crime is still underway.,(B)A number of people are frightened because of the terrorist attacks and have fled the capital city.,(C)There was a recorded decrease in crime rate right after the terrorist attack in almost all cities of the country.,(D)Intel reports show that the terrorists who pulled off the attack had been committing various other smaller crimes regularly to distract law enforcement from their true purposes.,(E)The government had initiated schemes to decrease poverty and provide better livelihood for the people just before the terrorist attack.,d,"5) Some commentators complain that a “litigation explosion” in the past decade has led to unreasonably high costs for U.S. businesses by encouraging more product liability suits against manufacturers. However, these complaints are based mainly on myth. Statistics show that the number of successful product liability suits has remained almost the same, and the average sum awarded in damages has grown no faster than the inflation rate.

Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument above?","(A)The number of unsuccessful suits has skyrocketed, imposing huge new legal expenses on businesses. ",(B)Several of the largest awards ever made in product liability cases occurred within the last two years. ,(C)The rise of the consumer movement has encouraged citizens to seek legal redress for product flaws. ,"(D) Lawyers often undertake product liability cases on a contingency basis, so their payment is based on the size of the damages awarded.",(E)) Juries often award damages in product liability suits out of emotional sympathy for an injured consumer. ,a,"5)Many home renters buy their first homes believing that it is clearly more profitable to make mortgage payments than to pay rent. Other costs, such as maintenance, property taxes, and insurance must be factored in, however. All housing expenses together total at least 40% of most homeowners' income.  It is not financially reasonable to spend any more than 30% of income on housing expenses.",(A)A minority of homeowners have reasonable housing expenses,(B)A majority of renters pay an unreasonable amount for housing expenses,(C)A majority of homeowners have unreasonable housing expenses,(D)A minority of homeowners have unreasonable housing expenses,"(E)The combination of property taxes, insurance, and home maintenance costs is greater than mortgage payments for a minority of homeowners",d,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,4,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40.48972950002644,40.48972950002644,c,2.5560688999830745,40.48972950002644,43.576799000031315,return,3.05095570004778,40.48972950002644,43.576799000031315,40.48972950002644,40.48972950002644,40.48972950002644,40.48972950002644,40.48972950002644,40.48972950002644,40.48972950002644,40.48972950002644,40.48972950002644,40.48972950002644,43.55998499999987,46.0622166999965,,001,2019_Oct_28_1149,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.89637925582791,

They have major office buildings in the downtowns of several cities in the 48 lower states, and rent this space to individual companies.  Megalimpet office spaces vary from small office to large suites, and every space has custom-designed wall-to-wall carpeting.  The carpet in several Megalimpet facilities needed replacing.  The winning bid for the nationwide carpet replacement was submitted by Bathyderm Carpet Company (BCC).  The bid contract involves all delivery costs, all installation, and any ongoing maintenance and upkeep while the carpet is under the three-year warranty.  Both BCC executives and independent consultants they hired felt BCC would be able to perform all these services for far less than their bid price; these circumstances would allow BCC to reap a considerable profit.

Which of the following, if true, most calls in question the argument that BCC will make a large profit from this contract with Megalimpet?","(A) All the carpets will have to be transported by train from BCC factory in Louisville, KY, to Megalimpet’s locations from coast to coast.","(B) BCC has already supplied carpets to a number of restaurant chains, and some of those spaces are as large as Megalimpet’s largest office spaces.

",(C) The carpet installation teams will have to cut different sizes of the carpets for the different size office suites in the Megalimpet buildings.,"(D) The material in BCC carpets degrades rapidly when it comes into contact with standard toner, found in most laser printers and photocopiers; the degraded sections are unsightly and smell bad, so they often need to be replaced.","(E) The next competing bid after BCC’s was 50% higher than BCC’s bid

",d,"2)The median house value in Butlerville has fallen significantly in the last few months. Nonetheless, the number of homes sold has been at its lowest level in seven years.

Which of the following best explains the discrepancy?",(A) The value of homes is not the only determinant of whether a house will be sold.,(B)The neighboring city of Jacksonburg has seen a recent surge in home sales.,(C)The Butlerville economy is struggling and the unemployment rate has reached historic rates.,(D)Analysts predict that the number of homes sold will increasing in the coming year.,(E)Homes priced over a million dollars have seen the sharpest decline in sales.,c,"2) Laird: Pure research provides us with new technologies that contribute to saving lives. Even more worthwhile than this, however, is its role in expanding our knowledge and providing new, unexplored ideas.

Kim: Your priorities are mistaken. Saving lives is what counts most of all. Without pure research, medicine would not be as advanced as it is.

Laird and Kim disagree on whether pure research...",(A)derives its significance in part from its providing new technologies,(B)expands the boundaries of our knowledge of medicine,(C)should have the saving of human lives as an important goal,(D)has its most valuable achievements in medical applications,(E)has any value apart from its role in providing new technologies to save lives,d,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,51.91798710002331,51.91798710002331,None,,51.91798710002331,52.501240300014615,return,0.5501663000322878,51.91798710002331,52.501240300014615,51.91798710002331,51.91798710002331,51.91798710002331,51.91798710002331,51.91798710002331,51.91798710002331,51.91798710002331,51.91798710002331,51.91798710002331,51.91798710002331,52.4841586999828,54.986240900005214,,001,2019_Oct_28_1149,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.89637925582791,
000:005,"3) A minor league baseball franchise experienced a drop in attendance this week after they suffered three losses by margins of ten runs or more last week.  Many spectators of those games wrote letters to the editors of the local sporting news, complaining of the poor play of the team in those three losses.  Nevertheless, the front office of this baseball franchise maintains that the team’s poor play in those three losses has nothing to do with this week’s decline in attendance.",(A) The spectators who wrote letters to the local sporting news were long-standing fans of this minor league baseball team.,(B) Many minor league baseball franchises attribute a drop in attendance to the quality of play of the team only after a string of losses.,(C) Other minor league teams in that region of the state reported a similar drop in attendance this week.,"(D) This was not the first time this team suffered multiple lopsided losses in a single week, prompting similar letters to the local sporting news.","(E) This minor league team is over four hours from the closest major league team, so many of the minor league team’s fans do not often attend major league games.",c,"3) Recently, an unusually high number of dolphins have been found dead of infectious diseases, and most of these had abnormally high tissue concentrations of certain compounds that, even in low concentrations, reduce dolphins' resistance to infection. The only source of these compounds in the dolphins' environment is boat paint.  Therefore, since dolphins rid their bodies of the compounds rapidly once exposure ceases, their mortality rate should decline rapidly if such boat paints are banned.

Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 

",(A) The levels of the compounds typically used in boat paints today are lower than they were in boat paints manufactured a decade ago.,"(B) In high concentrations, the compounds are toxic to many types of marine animals.",(C)The compounds break down into harmless substances after a few months of exposure to water or air. ,"(D)High tissue levels of the compounds have recently been found in some marine animals, but there is no recocrd of any of those animals dying in unusually large numbers rececntly ",(E)The compounds do not leach out of the boat paint if the paint is applied exactly in accordance with the manufacturer's directions. ,c,"3)The supernova event of 1987 is interesting in that there is still no evidence of the neutron star that current theory says should have remained after a supernova of that size. This is in spite of the fact that many of the most sensitive instruments ever developed have searched for the tell-tale pulse of radiation that neutron stars emit. Thus, current theory is wrong in claiming that supernovas of a certain size always produce neutron stars.

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?",(A)Most supernova remnants that astronomers have detected have a neutron star nearby.,(B)Sensitive astronomical instruments have detected neutron stars much farther away than the location of the 1987 supernova.,(C)The supernova of 1987 was the first that scientists were able to observe in progress.,(D)Several important features of the 1987 supernova are correctly predicted by the current theory.,(E)Some neutron stars are known to have come into existence by a cause other than a supernova explosion.,b,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,55.09051830001408,55.09051830001408,None,,55.09051830001408,55.46958189998986,return,0.3372686999500729,55.09051830001408,55.46958189998986,55.09051830001408,55.09051830001408,55.09051830001408,55.09051830001408,55.09051830001408,55.09051830001408,55.09051830001408,55.09051830001408,55.09051830001408,55.09051830001408,55.45346480002627,57.95560610003304,,001,2019_Oct_28_1149,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.89637925582791,
000:005,"4) In a few recent cases, some teenagers with advanced programming abilities used a new programming language, FANTOD, to hack into ETS and change their own SAT scores.  All of the teenagers convicted of this crime were highly skilled in programming FANTOD.  In light of these cases, some colleges have discounted the official SAT scores of applicants with a knowledge of FANTOD, and have required them to take special admission tests in supervised conditions on their own campuses.",(A) Most people who learn to program in FANTOD do so to commit some kind of hacking.,(B) Colleges should rely on their own admissions tests instead of the SATs,(C) Some students with knowledge of FANTOD are possibly placed at a disadvantage in the college admission process.,(D) Students who learn FANTOD tend to have much lower SAT scores than do their peers.,(E) Some colleges have not set any special requirements for applicants who have demonstrated knowledge of FANTOD,c,"4) Extensive housing is underway in Pataska Forest, the habitat of a large population of deer. Because deer feed at the edges of the forests, these deer will be attracted to the spaces alongside the new roads. Being cut through Pataska Forest to serve the new residential areas. Consequently, once the housing is occupied, the annual number of the forest's deer hit by cars will be much higher than before construction started. 

Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?",(A)The number of deer hit by commercial vehicles will not increase significantly when the housing is occupied.,(B)Deer will be as attracted to the forest edge around new houses as to the forest edge alongside roads.,"(C)In past years, the annual number of deer that have been hit by cars on existing roads through Pataska Forest has been very low.",(D) The development will leave sufficient forest to sustain a signiificant population of deer.,(E)No deer hunting will be allowed in Pataska Forest when the housing is occupied. ,d,"4)Political scientist: As a political system, democracy does not promote political freedom. There are historical examples of democracies that ultimately resulted in some of the most oppressive societies. Likewise, there have been enlightened despotisms and oligarchies that have provided a remarkable level of political freedom to their subjects.

The reasoning in the political scientist’s argument is flawed because it...",(A)confuses the conditions necessary for political freedom with the conditions sufficient to bring it about  ,(B)fails to consider that a substantial increase in the level of political freedom might cause a society to become more democratic,(C)appeals to historical examples that are irrelevant to the causal claim being made,(D)overlooks the possibility that democracy promotes political freedom without being necessary or sufficient by itself to produce it,(E)bases its historical case on a personal point of view,d,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,58.0491209999891,58.0491209999891,None,,58.0491209999891,58.455641000007745,return,0.3708485000533983,58.0491209999891,58.455641000007745,58.0491209999891,58.0491209999891,58.0491209999891,58.0491209999891,58.0491209999891,58.0491209999891,58.0491209999891,58.0491209999891,58.0491209999891,58.0491209999891,58.4395887000137,60.94146090000868,,001,2019_Oct_28_1149,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.89637925582791,
000:005,"5) In the twentieth century, the visual arts have embarked on major experimentation, from cubism to expressionism.  While tastes always vary, there are certainly some people who find beautiful objects of each of the art movements of the first half of the twentieth century.  In the latter half of the twentieth century, though, most works are so abstract or shocking that neither the critic nor the general public uses the word “beautiful” to describe them: indeed, sometimes late twentieth-century artists have, as one of their expressed goals, the creation of a work that no one could find beautiful.  Whatever these artists are creating may be intellectually engaging at some level, but it is no longer art.",(A) Art critics generally have a different appraisal of a work of art than does the general public.,(B) The meaning of any work of art is defined entirely by the ideas of the artist who created it.,(C) Beauty is a defining quality of art.,(D) All art movements of the latter half of the twentieth century are responses to the movements of the first half of the century.,(E) It is not possible for any work to be simultaneously beautiful and intellectually engaging.,c,"5)The Malbec grape, originally grown in France, has become the main varietal in Argentina. This is surprising because most Malbec grown in Argentina is grown at high altitudes, whereas the Malbec grape once was grown at low altitudes. Therefore, Argentinian winegrowers should grow the Malbec grape at low elevations.

Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the conclusion of the argument?","(A)The Bordeaux grape is the most popular grape in France, but is rarely, if ever, grown in Argentina.",(B)Some varietals are unable to grow at high altitudes. ,(C)The soil at high altitudes is filled with nutrients that help the Malbec grape grow. ,"(D) The Malbec vine is susceptible to phylloxera, a plant louse that only growss at low altitudes. ","(E)Malbec has recently enjoyed a surge in popularity, and can be found in many different countries. ",None,"5) Journalist: To reconcile the need for profits sufficient to support new drug research with the moral imperative to provide medicines to those who most need them but cannot afford them, some pharmaceutical companies feel justified in selling a drug in rich nations at one price and in poor nations at a much lower price. But this practice is unjustified. A nation with a low average income may still have a substantial middle class better able to pay for new drugs than are many of the poorer citizens of an overall wealthier nation.

Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the journalist’s reasoning?","(A)People who are ill deserve more consideration than do healthy people, regardless of their relative socioeconomic positions.","(B)Wealthy institutions have an obligation to expend at least some of their resources to assist those incapable of assisting themselves.
",(C)Whether one deserves special consideration depends on one’s needs rather than on characteristics of the society to which one belongs.,(D)The people in wealthy nations should not have better access to health care than do the people in poorer nations.,(E)Unequal access to health care is more unfair than an unequal distribution of wealth.,c,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,61.05858150002314,61.05858150002314,None,,61.05858150002314,61.20799530000659,return,0.11334290000377223,61.05858150002314,61.20799530000659,61.05858150002314,61.05858150002314,61.05858150002314,61.05858150002314,61.05858150002314,61.05858150002314,61.05858150002314,61.05858150002314,61.05858150002314,61.05858150002314,61.19145680003567,63.69381860003341,,001,2019_Oct_28_1149,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.89637925582791,
