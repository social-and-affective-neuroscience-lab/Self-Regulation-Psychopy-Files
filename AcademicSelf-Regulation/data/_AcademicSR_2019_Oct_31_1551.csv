0010:0015,"1)During the last 50 years in England, the national football team has had at least 60℅ of its players born during the months January to March. Similarly, in Germany, at least 50℅ of the team has been born during the first three months of the year. In fact, this statistic holds true for most European countries. This shows that in most European countries, parents with kids born early in the year are more likely to encourage a football career.

Which of the following best explains why the conclusion need not be the best explanation for the statistic?","(A)Of the remaining members, 60℅ or more tend to be born between the months of April and June.",(B)Parents of kids born in the second half of the year have displayed a measurable intent to promote scholarly careers,"(C)The age cut-off for kids to try out for a team in most European countries is calculated as on December 31 of any year and older the kid during trials, greater the chances of getting the right opportunities.",(D)The school year usually begins in April in most European countries and many parents are known to encourage students to work on their academics and not sports during the school year.,"(E)During the last 50 years, on average 30℅ of the kids have been born during the first three months of the year.

",(C)The chair of the new council must be a person who can communicate directly with the leaders of the nation's largest labor unions. ,(D)Most of the other members of the new council will be representatives of business management interests.,(E) An understanding of the needs and problems of labor is the only quallification necessary for the job of chairing the new council. ,e,"1)Biologists attached a radio transmitter to one of a number of wolves that had been released earlier in the White River Wilderness Area as part of a relocation project. The biologists hoped to use this wolf to track the movements of the whole pack. Wolves usually range over a wide area in search of prey, and frequently follow the migrations of their prey animals. The biologists were surprised to find that this particular wolf never moved more than five miles away from the location in which it was first tagged.


Which one of the following, if true, would by itself most help to explain the behavior of the wolf tagged by the biologists?","(A)The area in which the wolves were released was rocky and mountainous, in contrast to the flat, heavily-wooded area from which they were taken. ","(B)The wolf had been tagged and released by the biologists only three miles away from a sheep ranch that provided a large, stable population of prey animals.","(C)The White River Wilderness Area had supported a population of wolves in past years, but they had been hunted to extinction.","(D) Although the wolves in the White River Wilderness Area were under government protection, their numbers had been sharply reduced, within a few years of their release, by illegal hunting.","(E)The wolf captured and tagged by the biologists had split off from the main pack whose movements the biologists had hoped to study, and its movements did not represent those of the main pack.",b,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,67.75564450002275,None,70.77493590000086,None,1,1.332843700016383,70.77493590000086,None,70.77493590000086,None,70.77493590000086,None,70.77493590000086,None,70.77493590000086,None,70.77493590000086,None,70.77493590000086,None,72.13703139999416,73.6520826999913,73.8178571999888,None,73.8178571999888,None,73.8178571999888,None,73.8178571999888,None,2,1.1745518999523483,73.8178571999888,None,75.6187489300326,None,return,1.7828592999721877,73.8178571999888,None,76.05058330000611,None,a,1.7996006999746896,76.05058330000611,78.501974600018,return,2.3935198999824934,76.05058330000611,78.501974600018,76.05058330000611,None,76.05058330000611,None,76.05058330000611,None,76.05058330000611,None,76.05058330000611,None,78.48184580000816,80.98429280001437,,001,2019_Oct_31_1551,AcademicSR,3.2.0,59.7892310127435,
0010:0015,"2) Studies have established that children who watched 2 more hours of TV on an average daily basis during the first 15 years of their life were 50℅ more likely to be arrested for property crimes in the country. Researchers believe that these studies clearly establish that violence in movies and TV contribute to aggressive behavior in real life. On the other hand, there is no clear evidence that the programs that the kids watched on TV were violent in the first place. Even if we were to accept that TV watching contributed to the increased crime rate, it need not have been because of the nature of the programs. Perhaps, children who watched programs such as Adams and Samson, a funny sit-com about two blundering cops began perceiving all cops as incompetent.

0010:0015,"3) During medieval times, the administrative system was organized such that jobs were traditionally held within the same family. The eldest son of the village's blacksmith will take up his father’s business and become the next blacksmith. The other sons would join the army or serve the king in some fashion while the daughters did what their mother did. Although the world has undergone innumerable changes, the dynastic system has not undergone any change whatsoever. Children who have fathers who played major league baseball are 800 times more likely than other kids to become major league players themselves.

0010:0015,"4) A survey conducted recently in the city indicated that most college welfare-aid applicants understate the number of luxury items - such as cars and TVs – that their family owned, in an effort to maximize the amount of aid they can claim from the city. Paradoxically, the same study also found that many applicants claimed that they had running water and a gas connection even when they did not.

0010:0015,"5) Terrorist attacks invariably lead to tremendous losses in life, property, and morale of a country. The effects of a terrorist attack are not just immediate and can have long-lasting, trickle-down effects as well. The fear, for example, takes a long time to die down. However, some of these repercussions can be beneficial to the country. Take for instance, the recent terrorist attack on our capital city. In the weeks following the attack, the crime rate in the city came down significantly from what it was just before the attack. This must primarily be due to the increased presence of police resources that were moved to the area and is thus an indirect effect of the attack.

Which of the following options gives one more option as to why the crime rate decreased because of the terrorist attacks?",(A)The capital city is under increased monitoring leading to quick detection of crimes - many times while the crime is still underway.,(B)A number of people are frightened because of the terrorist attacks and have fled the capital city.,(C)There was a recorded decrease in crime rate right after the terrorist attack in almost all cities of the country.,(D)Intel reports show that the terrorists who pulled off the attack had been committing various other smaller crimes regularly to distract law enforcement from their true purposes.,(E)The government had initiated schemes to decrease poverty and provide better livelihood for the people just before the terrorist attack.,d,"5) Some commentators complain that a “litigation explosion” in the past decade has led to unreasonably high costs for U.S. businesses by encouraging more product liability suits against manufacturers. However, these complaints are based mainly on myth. Statistics show that the number of successful product liability suits has remained almost the same, and the average sum awarded in damages has grown no faster than the inflation rate.

Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument above?","(A)The number of unsuccessful suits has skyrocketed, imposing huge new legal expenses on businesses. ",(B)Several of the largest awards ever made in product liability cases occurred within the last two years. ,(C)The rise of the consumer movement has encouraged citizens to seek legal redress for product flaws. ,"(D) Lawyers often undertake product liability cases on a contingency basis, so their payment is based on the size of the damages awarded.",(E)) Juries often award damages in product liability suits out of emotional sympathy for an injured consumer. ,a,"5)Many home renters buy their first homes believing that it is clearly more profitable to make mortgage payments than to pay rent.

005:0010,"1) The National Farm Administration (NFA) has been concerned over the last decade with the struggles of barley growers.
Plan: In an effort to support these barley growers, two years ago, the NFA began a program of sending them, each autumn, a free special mix of fertilizer and enzymes designed to multiply barley yield, to be applied the following spring during first growth.  This mix had been stunningly successful in multiplying the yield of barley in laboratory conditions.
Results: Most barley growers reported little change in their economic status over this two year period.

Further information: All barley growers received the shipments, and all used them.  Weather conditions have been fair to optimal for barley growth over the past two years.

In light of the further information, which of the following, if true, does most to explain the result that followed the implementation of the plan?","(A) During these two years, most of the barley growers reported using no other fertilizer besides the special mix sent by the government",(B) The trucks that drove the special mix from the depot in Wisconsin to the individual farms sometime took as much as 4 or 5 days.,(C) Some of the enzymes in the special mix multiply the growth of a bacteria that feeds on the young barley plants.,(D) This program was implemented at a time when more than half of barley growers nationwide were reported barely breaking even in their yearly expenses.,"(E) This was the second such NFA program to aid barley growers; the first one, 14 years ago, was started with high hopes, but did little to change their situation.",c,"1) The Green Peas Grocery Store in the remote wealthy enclave of Luxville charges more than the Green Peas Grocery Store in Oak City charges for the same items. Clearly, on any given item, the Green Peas grocery franchise is taking advantage of its location in Luxville to reap higher profits on that item.

In evaluating the argument, it would be most useful to compare",(A) the selection of specialty items in the Oak City location with the selection of specialty items in the Luxville location.,(B)the cost of transporting merchandise to the Oak City location with the comparable cost to the Luxville location.,(C) the average cost of the same or comparable items at other grocery stores in Oak City with the average cost at other stores in Luxville.,(D)the percent of average household income spent on groceries in Oak City with the comparable percentage in Luxville.,(E) the cost of these items in Oak City and in Luxville with the cost at other Green Peas stores throughout the state.,b,"1)Several critics have claimed that any contemporary poet who writes formal poetry—poetry that is rhymed and metered—is performing a politically conservative act.

The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?",(A) No one who is a feminist is also politically conservative.,(B)No poet who writes unrhymed or unmetered poetry is politically conservative.,(C)No one who is politically progressive is capable of performing a politically conservative act,(D)Anyone who sometimes writes poetry that is not politically conservative never writes poetry that is politically conservative.,"(E)The content of a poet’s work, not the work’s form, is the most decisive factor in determining what political consequences, if any, the work will have.",c,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,98.87933750002412,None,98.87933750002412,None,98.87933750002412,None,98.87933750002412,None,1,3.428658200020436,98.87933750002412,None,102.3200340999756,None,return,4.278135799977463,98.87933750002412,None,103.41739439999219,None,a,2.153759600012563,103.41739439999219,106.18343769997591,return,2.712936100026127,103.41739439999219,106.18343769997591,103.41739439999219,None,103.41739439999219,None,103.41739439999219,None,103.41739439999219,None,103.41739439999219,None,106.16468709998298,108.66901960002724,,001,2019_Oct_31_1551,AcademicSR,3.2.0,59.7892310127435,
005:0010,"2) Linda: In the 1800s, it was found that one in every six women who gave birth in hospitals died of a fever they had contracted after delivering the child and that the mortality was not as high if they gave birth at home with the help of a mid wife. It was found that the doctors had a poorer sense of hygiene and that their dirty hands and instruments were leading to pathogens entering a woman's bloodstream. Thankfully, hygienic conditions today are much better and women are safer.

Fiona: But doctors today are so overworked that a number of doctors, while aware of the need for better hygiene, barely find the time to wash their hands. The likelihood of infections caused by doctors is probably not any better.

Which of the following can be used by Fiona to further establish that Linda need not be correct in her reasoning?","(A) A nationwide survey found that doctors, especially experienced ones, are more prone to the belief that they could not possibly be carrying pathogens.","(B) It is reported that around 50,000 people die every year in our country from hospital acquired infections.",(C ) Compulsory hand cleansing is strictly adhered to by all doctors and nurses before every major surgical procedure.,"(D) During a study, doctors handling newborn babies self reported a hand cleansing rate of 90℅.","(E ) Nurses are not any better than doctors in adhering to strict cleansing schedules, especially when busy.",a,"2) In the years since the city of London imposed strict air-pollution regulations on local industry, the number of bird species seen in and around London has increased dramatically. Similar air-pollution rules should be imposed in other major cities.

Each of the following is an assumption made in the argument above EXCEPT:","(A) In most major cities, air-pollution problems are caused almost entirely by local industry.",(B) Air-pollution regulations on industry have a significant impact on the quality of the air. ,(C)The air-pollution problems of other major cities are basically similar to those once suffered by London. ,(D)An increase in the number of bird species in and around a city is desirable.,(E)The increased sightings of bird species in and around London reflect an actual increase in the number of species in the area. ,a,"2) About two million years ago, lava dammed up a river in western Asia and caused a small lake to form. The lake existed for about half a million years. Bones of an early human ancestor were recently found in the ancient lake-bottom sediments that lie on top of the layer of lava. Therefore, ancestors of modern humans lived in western Asia between two million and one-and-a-half million years ago.

Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?",(A)There were no other lakes in the immediate area before the lava dammed up the river.,(B)The lake contained fish that the human ancestors could have used for food.,(C)The lava that lay under the lake-bottom sediments did not contain any human fossil remains.,(D)The lake was deep enough that a person could drown in it.,(E)The bones were already in the sediments by the time the lake dried up.,e,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,108.96901719999732,108.83138460002374,b,1.4279550000210293,108.96901719999732,111.0000339000253,return,1.9965710999676958,108.96901719999732,111.0000339000253,108.96901719999732,108.83138460002374,108.96901719999732,108.83138460002374,108.96901719999732,108.83138460002374,108.96901719999732,108.83138460002374,108.96901719999732,108.83138460002374,110.98378519999096,113.4845393000287,,001,2019_Oct_31_1551,AcademicSR,3.2.0,59.7892310127435,
005:0010,"3) The Americans with disabilities act (ADA) was designed to ensure that there is no discrimination against and unfair termination of differently-abled workers in the workplace. However, after the act was introduced, there has been a marked increase in unemployment among the differently-abled.

Which of the following best explains this seeming discrepancy?",(A) A number of differently-abled people chose not to work,"(B)Not willing to deal with the issues of workplace discrimination of the differently-abled, several companies recruited fewer of them in the first place","(C)Knowing that the act was about to be enforced, companies terminated some of the differently-abled while they had a chance",(D)There was no act introduced that would guarantee a job for the differently-abled,(E)The unemployment among the able-bodied has remained consistently high,b,"3) The ancient city of Cephesa was not buried by an eruption of Mt. Amnos is A.D. 310, as some believe. The eruption in the year 310 damaged the city, but it did not destroy it. Cephesa survived for another century before it finally met its destruction in another eruption around A.D. 415. 

Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the author’s claim that the city of Cephesa was not buried by the eruption of Mt. Amnos in A.D. 310?",(A)The city of Cephesa is mentioned in a historical work known to have been written in A.D. 400.,"(B)Coins bearing the image of an emperor who lived around A.D. 410 have been discovered in the ruins of Cephesa, which were preserved by the cinders and ashes that buried the city. ",(C)Geological evidence shows the erruption of Mt. Amnos in A.D. 415 deposited a 10-foot layer of lava on the city of Cephesa  ,(D) Artworks from the city of Cephesa have been found in the ruins of another city known to have been desrtoyed in A.D. 420. ,(E)A hostorical work written in A.D. 430 refers to the eruption of Mt. Amnos in A.D. 415,b,"3)In jurisdictions where use of headlights is optional when visibility is good, drivers who use headlights at all times are less likely to be involved in a collision than are drivers who use headlights only when visibility is poor. Yet Highway Safety Department records show that making use of headlights mandatory at all times does nothing to reduce the overall number of collisions.

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above?","(A)In jurisdictions where use of headlights is optional when visibility is good, one driver in four uses headlights for daytime driving in good weather.",(B)A law making use of headlights mandatory at all times is not especially difficult to enforce.,(C)Only very careful drivers use headlights when their use is not legally required.,(D)There are some jurisdictions in which it is illegal to use headlights when visibility is good.,(E)The jurisdictions where use of headlights is mandatory at all times are those where daytime visibility is frequently poor.,c,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,113.9170644999831,113.70919139997568,a,2.289664200041443,113.9170644999831,116.86647320003249,return,2.9081822000443935,113.9170644999831,116.86647320003249,113.9170644999831,113.70919139997568,113.9170644999831,113.70919139997568,113.9170644999831,113.70919139997568,113.9170644999831,113.70919139997568,113.9170644999831,113.70919139997568,116.85033719998319,119.34981729998253,,001,2019_Oct_31_1551,AcademicSR,3.2.0,59.7892310127435,
005:0010,"4) In an effort to curb drug abuse, the government has imposed strict laws to prosecute the dealers. However, such an initiative is unlikely to be effective. Prosecuting dealers will lead to a shortage of drugs. At the same time, because no efforts are being taken to curb demand, drugs will be sold at a premium, attracting more people to the very remunerative job of drug dealing. Therefore, to effectively reduce drug abuse, the government will have to prosecute the drug users and not dealers.

Which of the following is the most relevant information in evaluating the credibility of the argument?",(A)Whether efforts have been successfully taken in any other country to regulate drug users.,(B)Whether the payoff from selling drugs outweighs the severity of the punishment,(C)Whether drugs will continue to be sold at a premium when there are dealers in the market again,(D)Whether the majority of the users will be willing to pay a premium to continue to use the drugs,(E)Whether the government will be able to keep track of new dealers as and when they enter the market,d,"4) The burden of maintaining the U.S. highway system falls disproportionately on the trucking industry. Trucks represent only about 10 percent of the vehicles on U.S. roads. Yet road use taxes assessed on trucks amount to almost half the taxes paid for highway upkeep and repair.

Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument above?",(A)The trucking industry has enjoyed record after-tax profits in three of the past four years. ,"(B) Because of their weight, trucks cause over 50 percent of the damage sustained by highway surfaces each year. ","(C) Without an economically viable trucking industry, the cost of goods in the United States would rise significantly.",(D) Road use taxes paid by trucking companies have decreased by 3 percent over the past five years.,"(E)Due to years of neglect, U.S. highways today are badly in need of major repairs and rebuilding. ",b,"4)The Venetian Renaissance painter Vittore Carpaccio used sumptuous reds in most of his paintings. Since the recently discovered Venetian Renaissance painting Erato Declaiming contains notable sumptuous reds, it is probably by Carpaccio.

Which one of the following contains a pattern of flawed reasoning most similar to that in the argument above?","(A)Most Renaissance painters worked in a single medium, either tempera or oil. Since the Renaissance painting Calypso's Bower is in oil, its painter probably always used oil.","(B)In Italian Renaissance painting, the single most common subject was the Virgin and Child, so the single most common subject in Western art probably is also the Virgin and Child.","(C)Works of art in the Renaissance were mostly commissioned by patrons, so the Renaissance work The Dances of Terpsichore was probably commissioned by a patron.","(D)The anonymous painting St. Sebastian is probably an early Florentine painting since it is in tempera, and most early Florentine paintings were in tempera.","(E)Since late-Renaissance paintings were mostly in oil, the Venetian late-Renaissance painter Arnoldi, whose works are now lost, probably painted in oil.",d,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,3,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,119.58443530002842,119.47598930000095,b,1.774229800037574,119.58443530002842,121.86643390002428,return,2.239840299997013,119.58443530002842,121.86643390002428,119.58443530002842,119.47598930000095,119.58443530002842,119.47598930000095,119.58443530002842,119.47598930000095,119.58443530002842,119.47598930000095,119.58443530002842,119.47598930000095,121.84962850000011,124.35154360003071,,001,2019_Oct_31_1551,AcademicSR,3.2.0,59.7892310127435,
005:0010,"5) Alan: In the last 15 years, most of the criminals who were convicted of theft or murder were from the lower income classes and had not completed high school. Therefore, the government has to spend more money on reducing poverty and increase funding to education. Because terrorism is the most severe of all crimes, such measures would bring down overall crime rate and reduce threat from terrorism.

Dylan: A study that was conducted in a country known to produce a number of terrorists showed that on average the terrorists were better educated than the overall population and that they did not necessarily come from lower income classes. This is probably because crimes such as theft are committed for personal gain while terrorism is for political or religious gain.

Which of the following best describes Dylan's response to Alan?",(A)Dylan changes the direction of the argument entirely by discussing the scenario in a different country,(B)Dylan partially agrees with Alan's reasoning but refutes his recommendation to the government,(C)Dylan converts a causal argument made by Alan into a generalization applicable universally,(D)Dylan challenges Alan's reasoning by explaining why two situations that Alan perceives as similar are not,"(E)While Alan arrives at a conclusion by drawing an analogy, Dylan arrives at the same conclusion by refuting the analogy",d,"5)No nation can long survive unless its people are united by a common tongue. For proof, we need only consider Canada, which is being torn asunder by conflicts between French-speaking Quebec and the other provinces, which are dominated by English speakers.

Which of the following, if true, most effectively challenges the author’s conclusion?",(A)Conflicts over language have led to violent clashes between the Basque-speaking minority in Spain and the Spanish-speaking majority. ,(B)Proposals to declare English the official language of the United States have met with resistance from members of Hispanic and other minority groups. ,"(C)Economic and political differences, along with linguistic ones, have contributed to the provincial conflicts in Canada.","(D)The public of India, in existence since 1948, has a population that speaks hundreds of different, though related, languages.

Thirty years ago, a first-class letter delivery cost only three cents. The price has increased sevenfold since then while the reliability and speed of the delivery have declined.",(A)The volume of mail handled by the postal service has increased dramatically over the last thirty years.,(B)Unprecedented increases in the cost of fuel for trucks and planes have put severe upward pressures on postal delivery costs.,(C) Private delivery services usually charge more than the postal service does for comparable delivery services.,(D) The average delivery time for a first-class letter three decades ago was slightly longer than it is today.,(E)The average level of consumer prices overall has increased fourfold over the last thirty years.,a,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,4,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,124.98824470001273,124.67817829997512,c,0.902372800046578,124.98824470001273,126.24972560000606,return,1.217552899965085,124.98824470001273,126.24972560000606,124.98824470001273,124.67817829997512,124.98824470001273,124.67817829997512,124.98824470001273,124.67817829997512,124.98824470001273,124.67817829997512,124.98824470001273,124.67817829997512,126.23319930001162,128.7344244000269,,001,2019_Oct_31_1551,AcademicSR,3.2.0,59.7892310127435,
