REACT,0015:0020,"1) In 2009, there was a sharp increase in the number of people who were reported to have died in the country during the first week of the year, compared with the first week of the previous ten years. There seems to be no reason to explain this disproportionately high number of deaths especially because the reports were widespread in the country and there was no epidemic spreading through the country at that point in time. Moreover, most of the deaths were not among the young and could not even be attributed to binge drinking in celebration of the new year.

Which of the following can then explain the discrepancy?","(A)The government announced in 2008 that estate taxes, payable by the heirs on someone's death, would be abolished effective from the new year.","(B)Astrologists predicted that 2009 was a good year to die in, for salvation of the soul.",(C)The statistic is an anomaly that has no logical explanation.,"(D)The price of some cancer drugs and chemotherapy increased by 10% in January 2009, making treatment more expensive than before.",(E)An earthquake in one of the cities during December 2008 made hospital care availability more difficult for regular illnesses.,a,"1) In an experiment, two different types of recorded music were played for neonates in adjacent nurseries in a hospital. In nursery A, classical music was played; in nursery B, rock music was played. After two weeks, it was found that the babies in nursery A cried less, suffered fewer minor ailments, and gained more weight than did the babies in nursery B.

In evaluating the validity of the conclusion suggested by the experiment above, it would be most important to know which of the following?",(A) The musical preferences of the parents of the two groups of newborns. ,(B) Whether the newborns in both nurseries were equally healthy and happy at the start of the experiment. ,(C)Whether loud rock music can damage the hearing of newborns.,(D)What the average weight of the neonates wasa before and after the experiment. ,(E)Whether the music was played in the nurseries at all times or only at certain times.,b,"1)The price of a barrel of crude oil fell by 15 percent over the last month. Economists point to several causes, including the discovery of new reserves of oil, the increased accessibility of alternative sources of fuel, the growth of mass transit, the decline of car sales, and the increase in non-fuel-consuming means of transportation, such as bicycles, over the same time frame.

Which of the following does the above argument NOT imply?","(A)The discovery of new reserves of oil has increased the supply, created a surplus, and thus driven the price of oil down.",(B)People are more likely to purchase new cars if the price of oil is low.,"(C)If they have access to both, some people would rather use alternative sources of fuel instead of oil.","(D)The growth of mass transit systems, which transport more people and use less fuel, has reduced demand for oil and driven the price of oil down.",(E)The increased accessibility of alternative sources of fuel has reduced the demand for oil and thus driven the price of a barrel of crude oil down.,b,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,21.857319199945778,None,space,16.291291899979115,21.857319199945778,None,43.699506300035864,None,40.699265599949285,None,46.200564600061625,None,1,3.9161927001550794,46.200564600061625,None,46.200564600061625,None,46.200564600061625,None,46.200564600061625,None,46.200564600061625,None,46.200564600061625,None,46.200564600061625,None,50.138156899949536,51.639415399869904,51.6605429998599,None,51.6605429998599,None,51.6605429998599,None,51.6605429998599,None,1,5.608119900105521,51.6605429998599,None,57.29506599996239,None,return,6.24722609994933,51.6605429998599,None,57.92957070004195,None,space,42.82697670022026,57.92957070004195,None,100.89499429985881,None,None,100.89499429985881,102.29808439989574,return,1.3636852998752147,100.89499429985881,102.29808439989574,100.89499429985881,None,100.89499429985881,None,100.89499429985881,None,100.89499429985881,None,100.89499429985881,None,102.28156249993481,104.78356750006787,,001,2019_Dec_05_1324,AcademicSR,3.2.4,60.065110516183694,
REACT,0015:0020,"2)It seems that medical care is constantly improving and is far better today than it was a few years ago. New medicines are being developed, and at a lower cost. Technological advancements are being made and new treatments are devised. However, hospital care has not improved as much as expected. Most hospitals do not have a large enough ER that can handle a sudden influx of patients and the number of people who die in a hospital due to reasons other than what they got admitted for is staggeringly high.

All of the following underscore the author’s argument EXCEPT",(A) Most hospitals require doctors to do so much paperwork that they spend insufficient time on direct patient care.,"(B)Most hospitals recirculate air and therefore, it is very easy for diseases such as anthrax to spread through the hospital.","(C)In smaller cities, the ambulance service is on a voluntary basis and the response time for calls is much lower than the national average, leading to a higher loss of life.",(D)A number of doctors in private hospitals are not held accountable by the administration for the loss of patients.,(E)Doctors in most private hospitals have performance appraisals based on how much money they have brought in for the hospital rather than based on how effectively they treated patients.,c,"2) June is taller than Kristin.

However, researchers have identified that the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide released into the atmosphere are not as potent as the methane emitted by cud-chewing animals such as cows when they fart or belch. Therefore, if you drive a hybrid electric car to the grocery, any favor that you would do to the environment would be offset if you end up buying beef.

REACT,0015:0020,"4) There are several scientific studies and research findings that are constantly discussed and publicized in the news media. Some of these are contrary to other research studies that are published. This conflict in information makes people believe that either science is inaccurate or that they can ‘choose’ which scientific result they want to believe in. However, neither of these beliefs is accurate. Science is not inaccurate or subjective. Most of the time, scientific studies show inconsistent results either because of inaccuracies in methodology adopted or because of misrepresentation of actual results by the news media. For example, a recent study done on just 15 women showed that eating chocolate was not necessarily harmful during pregnancy and the media reported that chocolate was actually beneficial to the foetus.

Which of the following best further corroborate the author’s argument?",(A) A study result that shows that the effect of automobile pollution on global warming is marginal.,(B) An unverified study gaining popularity because it seemingly showed that red wine reduces the risk of cancer on a very small control group.,(C)A new study that further collaborates an earlier finding that the consumption of some types of berries lower the risk of heart failure.,(D)The news media highlighting the fact that a study had clearly proven that effects of certain drugs on rats need not be the same as on humans.,"(E)People not knowing what to believe because one study shows that a certain disease is caused by genetic factors, while another shows that it also caused by lifestyle factors.",b,"4) Last year, Mayor Stephens established a special law-enforcement task force with the avowed mission of eradicating corruption in city government.

REACT,0015:0020,"5)John: A study has identified that many soldiers received less-than-honorable discharges from the army due to charges of misconduct that can actually be attributed to conditions such as PTSD and traumatic brain injury. This is a military practice that is unfair and must be avoided. The army must take responsibility for the same and stop discharging their soldiers dishonorably.

Christy: While it is true that it is unfair to the soldiers to be discharged so from the army, it has also been found that there are no sufficient measures or systems that have been created to identify whether the misconduct was due to trauma or due to other reasons. Moreover, to enforce discipline in the ranks, it is important for the army to follow a uniform rule for all the soldiers.

Which of the following statements can Christy further add to her argument?","(A)If there is no proper system, then the army should have developed a proper system by now.",(B)Complete elimination of dishonorable discharges would make it more difficult for the army to monitor and evaluate the soldiers.,(C)It is not the army’s fault that there has been no system developed to help those with PTSD,"(D)Studies have also found that showing consideration for some soldiers has led to others taking advantage, indirectly promoting misconduct.",(E)There have been instances when the army has been able to identify the reasons for the misconduct and acted accordingly.,d,"5) Coursemetrics, a privately owned on-line education platform, recently offered courses targeted to college students.
