000:005,"1) In order to combat Carville’s rampant homeless problem, Mayor Bloomfield recently proposed a ban on sleeping outdoors in the city’s many parks. He claims that such a measure will force the homeless to either leave Carville or to find means other than sleeping in public parks.

Which of the following, if true, suggests that Mayor Bloomfield’s plan will be successful?","(A) Until the ban, the city’s many homeless shelters were at less than fifty percent occupancy.",(B) Many homeless tend to congregate underneath Carville’s numerous overpasses.,(C) Adjacent cities have even tougher measures on the homeless sleeping outdoors.,"(D) The percent of Carville’s population that has been homeless has been slowly decreasing in the last five years.

","(E) Mayor Jonesmith, Mayor Bloomfield’s predecessor, had been far more tolerant towards the city’s homeless population.",a,"1) The Dvorak keyboard requires less finger movement than the ubiquitous QWERTY keyboard. As a result, Dvorak keyboard users are not only able to type more words per minute, but are also less vulnerable to both repetitive stress disorder and carpal tunnel syndrome. Nonetheless, businesses, as well as consumers, have not adopted the Dvorak keyboard. Clearly, if the Dvorak keyboard is to become more widely used, its benefits must be more widely touted.

 

Which of the following, if true, most threatens the author’s conclusion?",(A)The initial cost of manufacturing a Dvorak keyboard will be more expensive than that of a QWERTY keyboard.,(B)Many who have attempted using a Dvorak keyboard claim that learning the configuration of keys takes weeks.,(C)Those suffering from repetitive stress injuries often attribute the injuries to multiple factors.,"(D)Businesses that have educated employees on the benefits of the Dvorak keyboard, have found that employees continue to use the Qwerty keyboard.",(E)Businesses have found that many employees who believe the Qwerty keyboard is responsible for stress-induced injuries are unaware of the Dvorak keyboard.,d,"1)Executive: We recently ran a set of advertisements in the print version of a travel magazine and on that magazine’s website. We were unable to get any direct information about consumer response to the print ads. However, we found that consumer response to the ads on the website was much more limited than is typical for website ads. We concluded that consumer response to the print ads was probably below par as well.

The executive’s reasoning does which one of the following?",(A)bases a prediction of the intensity of a phenomenon on information about the intensity of that phenomenon’s cause,"(B)uses information about the typical frequency of events of a general kind to draw a conclusion about the probability of a particular event of that kind
",(C)infers a statistical generalization from claims about a large number of specific instances,(D)uses a case in which direct evidence is available to draw a conclusion about an analogous case in which direct evidence is unavailable,(E)bases a prediction about future events on facts about recent comparable events,d,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,8.549406799953431,None,11.575838299992029,None,1,0.3683426000061445,11.575838299992029,None,11.575838299992029,None,11.575838299992029,None,11.575838299992029,None,11.575838299992029,None,11.575838299992029,None,11.575838299992029,None,11.969123399991076,13.469952299958095,13.508260199974757,None,13.508260199974757,None,13.508260199974757,None,13.508260199974757,None,1,0.48410859995055944,13.508260199974757,None,14.020581699965987,None,return,1.346467199968174,13.508260199974757,None,15.014790199988056,None,a,1.633628099982161,15.014790199988056,18.790940399980173,return,3.744145300006494,15.014790199988056,18.790940399980173,15.014790199988056,None,15.014790199988056,None,15.014790199988056,None,15.014790199988056,None,15.014790199988056,None,18.77461919997586,20.27567929995712,,001,2019_Oct_28_1148,AcademicSR,3.2.4,59.87063154400439,
