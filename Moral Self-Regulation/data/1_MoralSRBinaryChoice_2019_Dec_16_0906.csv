"In this study you will be asked to evaluate a number of moral dilemmas under various conditions. 

You will be presented with 10 different scenario contexts and will respond to 10 conditions for each one.

For each scenario, you will proceed through four screens. The first three screens will start to describe a situation that you are hypothetically faced with and an action that you could perform in response to that situation.

a) a number of people involved in part of the scenario, and 

b) a likelihood that something will happen

You will be evaluating this scenario given a number of variations of these features.

First, you will see a "+" in the middle of the screen. Any time that this is up, all you need to do is fixate on the "+" and prepare to respond to the next trial. 

Next, you will see text appear indicating the missing information. You should then evaluate the action in question in the context of these values given, and make a judgment of its moral acceptibility.

You will then indicate the course of action you would like to take in each scenario; by pressing either 'y' on your keyboard to indicate 'Yes', or 'n' to indicate 'No.'

You will only have 10 seconds to respond to each variation. If the "+" appears before you have responded, that means you are out of time. If this happens, do not attempt to respond. Simply look at the "+" and wait for the next trial.

While we want your answers to be thoughtful, you may find that in some cases the right answer seems immediately obvious. If that happens, it's okay to answer quickly. There are no trick questions, and in every case we have done our best to make the relevant information as clear as possible. 

Note, however, that no two scenarios are the same, although many are similar to each other.

For example, it might say that if you do X, then Y will happen, and you might think that this is not realistic, that Y might not necessarily happen if you do X. If you find yourself having these sorts of doubts, you should suspend disbelief and assume that the situation really is the way it's described, even if it doesn't seem realistic to you.

Likewise, you may feel that you need more information than is provided about the situation before you can give your answer. If this happens, you should make your best guess about what you think the situation is like without making any unneccessary assumptions.
